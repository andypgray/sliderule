///     <c>arch.Type</c> makes of it; one call takes one shape, and naming both in a single rule means
///     wrapping the type with <c>arch.Type</c>. Every list needs at least one operand, and a rule with

///     <see cref="MustOnlyBeReferencedByItself" />, <see cref="MustNotReferenceEachOther" /> and
///     <see cref="MustNotHaveCircularReferences" />. A subject that matches no type fails the rule.

///     match nothing and at least one of them is a pattern (a layer, a namespace, a project, a narrowed
///     <c>arch.Types</c>), the check warns that the rule is inert. Where some of its operands match and a
///     pattern among them matches nothing, the check warns that the rule is partly inert, naming that
///     pattern, and the rule passes or fails on what the other operands find. Each name in a
///     <c>Named</c> list counts as a pattern of its own here, so <c>arch.Types.Named("A", "B")</c>
///     with no type named <c>B</c> warns naming <c>types named `B`</c>. The <c>MustOnly</c> verbs that
///     take a list run the same per-pattern test over their allow-list, whether or not the rest of it
///     matched. An allowed pattern that matches nothing warns that the rule is stricter than written,

///     for a bare <c>typeof</c> operand the codebase never mentions, or for <c>MustNotUse</c> and
