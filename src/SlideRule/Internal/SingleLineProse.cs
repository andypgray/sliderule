///     Either terminator, so a value carrying a bare CR is caught as well as one carrying a newline.
///     Blankness is deliberately not folded in: the spec catalog reports blank under its own code, and the
///     two baseline readers say "blank or multi-line" in one breath because their channel has one message.
