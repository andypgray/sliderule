///     A type or member slot holds a Roslyn <c>DocumentationCommentId</c> string, and a project slot
///     holds <c>project:</c> followed by the project's name, so an entry survives a file move and any
///     amount of reformatting; renaming the type or member it names, or moving it to another namespace
///     or containing type, is what makes it a different entry. Two entries are equal when all three
///     slots match ordinally, which leaves <see cref="Because" /> and <see cref="SiteCount" /> free to
///     be re-recorded without forking the entry. An entry no violation in a run matches is stale (the
