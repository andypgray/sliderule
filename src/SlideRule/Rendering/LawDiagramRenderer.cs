///     <see cref="GraphDiagramRenderer" /> draws. Pure over an <see cref="ArchitectureModel" />, with no
///     codebase extracted, no check run and no baseline read, so the drawing says what the rules are and
///     never how the code is currently doing against them. The output is always LF and carries no
///     timestamp or tool version, so an unchanged spec re-renders to no diff at all.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The same plain dialect as the survey: <c>flowchart LR</c>, quoted labels, <c>accTitle</c> and
///     <c>accDescr</c>, no colours and no <c>classDef</c>, so structure carries the whole meaning. A
///     solid <c>--x</c> is a forbidden reference, a dotted <c>-.-x</c> is grandfathered debt, an arrow
///     <c>--&gt;</c> marks the only references allowed, a box inside a box is a namespace inside
///     another, and the doubled box inside a quarantine is its sanctioned surface; a legend under the
///     diagram spells out whichever of those the spec uses. Labels carry no counts, so a committed
///     drawing does not change every time the code does. A rule the drawing cannot place, such as a verb
///     with no direction or a subject that is not a region of code, is listed by rule ID beneath the
