/// <summary>
///     Works out which directory each layer's local-rules card belongs in. A layer gets a card when at
///     least one Enforce or Migrate rule has that layer as its subject: narrowing the layer with
///     adjectives or <c>Except</c> still counts, and so does naming it as one cell of a family, but a
///     union of selections does not, having no single home directory, so a union's rules stay in the
///     root block alone. Rules a scope produced are left out, because the scope's own card carries
///     them.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     A card lands in the deepest directory holding every file inside the solution directory that declares
///     one of the layer's types, so it covers the layer and as little else as it can; a layer whose types are
///     spread across the solution therefore lands high up. Where several projects compile a type of one name,
///     a layer defined by a project counts only that project's copy, and a layer defined by namespace globs
///     counts every copy. A file outside the solution directory never moves a card, so a file a project
///     compiles from a package folder leaves the card where the project's own files put it. A layer that
///     matches no type in the solution, or only types declared outside the solution directory, comes back
///     with a null directory and the reason, for the caller to report or ignore. A purpose alone gets no
///     card: a card exists to carry rules.
/// </remarks>
// Scope children are excluded by their payload rather than their posture: a quarantined layer's
// containment subject is layer-anchored, but its story belongs to the scope card and the two
// emission keys must not double-emit — and keying on the payload means a posture added later cannot
// slip through the filter. A caution over a layer would be excluded even without it: its tripwire
// carries no constraint to read a subject from, so it anchors nothing.
