/// <remarks>
///     Only two glob shapes are containment-comparable: an exact name (<c>SlideRule</c>) and a
///     subtree whose prefix carries no wildcard (<c>MyApp.Web.*</c>). Every other legal shape — an
///     interior standalone <c>*</c>, a partial-segment <c>*</c>, the lone <c>*</c> — matches a set no
///     prefix comparison can decide, so it is reported as not contained. That is the deliberate
///     asymmetry: a false negative costs a drawing one flat node, and a false positive nests a node under
///     a parent that does not contain it, which is the diagram telling the reader something untrue.
