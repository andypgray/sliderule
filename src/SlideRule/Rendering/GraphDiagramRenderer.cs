///     Draws a solution's projects and the references between them as a Mermaid flowchart: the body
///     <c>sliderule render --diagram</c> writes into a file's managed block. Pure over a
///     <see cref="GraphSummary" />, so the drawing shows exactly what the <c>sliderule graph</c>
///     survey reports. The output is always LF and carries no timestamp or tool version, so an unchanged
///     codebase re-renders to no diff at all.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The drawing is deliberately plain: <c>flowchart LR</c> with quoted labels,
///     <c>accTitle</c> and <c>accDescr</c> for screen readers, and no <c>%%{init}%%</c> block,
///     <c>classDef</c> or colours, so it renders correctly for a reader in a light or a dark theme.
///     Structure carries the meaning: a solid <c>--&gt;</c> is a cross-project reference the code
///     actually makes, and a dotted <c>-.-&gt;</c> is a project reference that is declared and never
///     used. Labels carry no type or reference counts, so a committed drawing does not change every time
///     the code does; the counts are in the <c>sliderule graph</c> survey, which nothing commits.
