///     grandfathered: entries no current violation matched (<see cref="Stale" />), matched edge entries
///     whose observed site count came in under the recorded one (<see cref="Shrunk" />), and matched edge
///     entries that record no count at all (<see cref="Uncounted" />). A struct so that

///     Arrives whole rather than as three ints in a row on the constructor that takes it, and that is a
///     correctness matter rather than a tidiness one: same-typed positionals in a row are a transposition
///     no compiler can catch. All three are required, for the same reason — a trailing default would let
///     a single argument mean whichever of them the caller had in mind.
