///     A set of projects the spec talks about, as build artifacts rather than as the types they

///     <c>Named</c>, <c>Matching</c>, <c>Packable</c>, <c>Except</c> or <c>Where</c>, each of which
///     returns a new selection; finish it with a project verb (<c>MustOnlyTarget</c>, <c>MustTarget</c>,
///     <c>MustReferenceNoPackages</c>, <c>MustOnlyReferencePackages</c>, <c>MustNotReferencePackages</c>,
///     <c>MustSetProperty</c>, <c>MustLockPackages</c>, <c>MustNotBePackable</c> or <c>Must</c>), which
///     yields the <see cref="Constraint" /> a rule takes. The facts these verbs read are what a build
///     evaluation answers, so a setting a shared props file supplies counts and a project nothing
///     evaluated passes rather than fails. For the types a project declares, use
///     <c>arch.Project(name)</c> instead. Immutable and reusable: assign one to a variable and use it
///     in as many rules as you like, on the <see cref="Arch" /> it was built from.

// A closed hierarchy: the constructor is private protected, so no foreign assembly can add a node,
// and it is disjoint from both Selection and MemberSelection so the shared adjective and verb names
// bind by receiver type (GRAMMAR §3.2). Unlike a member selection there is no underlying type
// selection to borrow an owner from — a project here is the build artifact, not a set of types — so
// Owner is carried directly, and that is what the foreign-Arch walk reads (§8 item 10).
