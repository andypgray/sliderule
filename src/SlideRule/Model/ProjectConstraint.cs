///     A reified project-artifact constraint (GRAMMAR §4.10): a <see cref="ProjectSelection" /> subject
///     plus a packaging modal verb phrase. Its inherited <see cref="Constraint.Subject" /> is
///     <see langword="null" />, because a project selection is not a type selection and there is no
///     underlying one to stand in — unlike <see cref="MemberConstraint" />, which has
///     <c>MemberSubject.Source</c> to hand up.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     That null is the whole nullability contract on <see cref="Constraint.Subject" />: it is null
///     exactly here, so every type-side walk either dispatches on the constraint type first (the sentence
///     renderer, the checker) or is already downstream of such a dispatch. The compiler's nullable-flow
///     analysis is what audits that claim — a reader that forgets the dispatch is a warning, not a
///     <see cref="NullReferenceException" /> in the field.
