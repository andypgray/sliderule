/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     A head prefix for the same reference-position reason
///     <see cref="MemberAttributedWithAdjective" /> gives: a member subject renders its type selection in
///     reference position, so an inline "that are static" would land after that reference and read as a
///     claim about the types. Prefixing keeps the fact attached to the noun it narrows.
///     Member head prefixes <b>concatenate</b> in authoring order (they are an intersection, so the
///     sentence must say both), which is observable here: a shape prefix can stand beside one from
///     another family.
