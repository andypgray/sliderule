///     A <em>family</em> — <c>arch.Each(dispatch, tracking, invoicing)</c> or
///     <c>arch.Each(arch.Projects.Matching("Nop.Plugin.*"))</c> — a noun that carries a partition of the
///     types it names into <em>cells</em>, copy by copy where several projects declare one type
///     (GRAMMAR §5.1). Reference fragment: "each of the Dispatch, Tracking and Invoicing layers", "each of
///     the projects matching <c>`Nop.Plugin.*`</c>". A bare family speaks in the collective voice
///     (GRAMMAR §6).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Exactly one of <see cref="Layers" /> and <see cref="Projects" /> is non-null, which is what the
///     two constructors guarantee. The cells are read only in the four places GRAMMAR §5.1 lists; to
///     every other verb, walk and renderer a family is the union of its cells.
///     <para>
///         A one-cell layer family renders exactly as the cell would, in both positions: the family verbs
///         and the per-cell self still apply to it, and a loop that built a family of one has said the same
///         thing the cell says (the §5.1 union identity). The project form's cell count is a codebase fact
///         rather than a spec one, so its sentence always says "each of".
