///     matches accesses whose compile-time receiver is the declaring type: a ban on a concrete member
///     does not catch calls made through an interface-typed receiver, and a ban on an interface member
///     does not catch direct calls on the concrete type. Not a <see cref="Selection" />: it takes no
///     adjectives and no verbs, and it may be reused across rules built on the same
///     <see cref="Arch" />.
