///     What a project predicate sees: the facts of one project as a build artifact, handed to the
///     lambda in <c>.Where(project =&gt; ..., description)</c> and
///     <c>.Must(project =&gt; ..., description)</c> on a project selection. The facts are what a build
///     evaluation answers, not what the project file spells, so a setting supplied by a shared props
///     file above the project, or defaulted by the SDK, is a fact here and absent from the file. Where
///     nothing evaluated a project the fact is missing rather than defaulted (the lists come back
///     empty and the tri-state facts null), so a predicate that reads unknown as false asserts
///     something nothing measured; treat unknown as passing, as the project verbs do. The lambda runs
///     when the check runs, not when the spec is loaded; the description beside it is required, and it
///     is the description, never the lambda, that the generated agent context and the check report
///     print. New facts are added in later versions and the ones here keep their meaning.

// Read by the predicate authors this contract exists for rather than through the interface
// in-solution, so solution-wide search finds only the implementations and calls the members unused.
