///     construction of <c>MyApp.Web.IHandler&lt;T&gt;</c>. It appears in the hierarchy facts a type carries:

///     <see cref="TypeNode.AttributeConstructions" />.

///     Keeping both names is what lets a rule tell "any construction" from "that one":
///     <c>Implementing(typeof(IHandler&lt;&gt;))</c> matches on <see cref="Definition" />'s
///     <see cref="TypeNode.FullName" />, and <c>Implementing(typeof(IHandler&lt;Order&gt;))</c> on this
///     <see cref="FullName" />. Reference edges keep no constructions at all: they record definitions.
