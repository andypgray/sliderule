///     One project in the extracted codebase: its name, whether the solution file declares it, the
///     projects it references, the frameworks it targets, the packages it declares, and whether it packs
///     and locks its restore. These are the facts a rule about a project is judged on, so they are what

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The framework, package, packable and lock facts are evaluated rather than read out of the project
///     file's XML: the value that wins is very often set somewhere else, in a
///     <c>Directory.Build.props</c> above the project, or nowhere at all, as an SDK default, and only an
///     evaluation knows which. Each is paired with the <c>file:line</c> that set it, and
///     <see langword="null" /> means the evaluation never happened rather than that the property is off,
///     the same reading <see cref="SolutionMember" /> holds to. Every project verb passes on a fact that
///     is <see langword="null" />, so a load that could not evaluate a project reports gaps rather than
