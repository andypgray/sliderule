///     Parameter types are recorded at their definition and taken apart: <c>IEnumerable&lt;IFoo&gt;</c>

///     constructor, a record's copy constructor and static constructors declare nothing to record; and enums
///     and delegates contribute none. An injected type only a package or the framework declares is in
///     <see cref="CodebaseModel.Types" /> like any other, so a rule can name it. Both ends are the very type
///     instances that list holds, so compare them by reference rather than by name, and the same parameter
///     is also recorded as an ordinary reference in <see cref="CodebaseModel.Edges" />, never instead of it.
