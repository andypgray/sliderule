/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         Matching and identity are deliberately different grains. A ban is written against a declaring
///         type and a name, so one ban covers every overload and there is no signature here; a baseline
///         records <see cref="SymbolId" /> instead, so a grandfathered <c>Wait()</c> rewritten as
///         <c>Wait(timeout)</c> is a new violation and fails the check.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="ContainingType" /> is the very type instance <see cref="CodebaseModel.Types" /> lists,
///         so a member and its declaring type are one object graph. Members are recorded at their
///         definition, so <c>Task&lt;int&gt;.Result</c> and <c>Task&lt;string&gt;.Result</c> are one member
///         here. An accessor is recorded as its property or event, and a call written in extension-method
///         form is recorded against the static method that declares it.
