/// <summary>
///     One fully-qualified name that means two different types: a project in the solution declares it, and
///     an assembly no project of the solution produces supplies it as well — a stand-in written under a
///     package's own namespace, a polyfill under a framework one. Read them from
///     <see cref="CodebaseModel.ShadowedNames" />.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Both types are in <see cref="CodebaseModel.Types" />, and every reference reaches whichever one the
///     referencing compilation actually bound: a project that references the package reaches the package's
///     type and never the declaring project's. A rule naming the type by name reaches both, and a rule
///     naming a project tells them apart, because the supplied type carries the supplying assembly's name in
///     place of a project's. This is the same split <see cref="CodebaseModel.MergeNotes" /> states in prose,
///     in a form a caller can act on without parsing a sentence or grouping
///     <see cref="CodebaseModel.Types" /> by name.
