///     One dependency-injection registration the source spells out: a service type registered with a
///     <see cref="Lifetime" />, and where the call names one, the implementation type behind it. Read them
///     from <see cref="CodebaseModel.ServiceRegistrations" />. The calls recognized are
///     <c>AddSingleton</c>, <c>AddScoped</c> and <c>AddTransient</c> with their <c>TryAdd</c> forms,
///     <c>AddHostedService</c>, <c>AddDbContext</c>, <c>AddDbContextPool</c> and <c>AddHttpClient</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         A call is recognized by the method it resolves to and never by its name alone: it must come from
///         <c>Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</c> and take an <c>IServiceCollection</c> first. So a
///         look-alike of your own is not counted, while a helper of your own whose body calls one of those
///         methods is. Everything registered another way is absent — assembly scanning, keyed overloads, a
///         raw <c>ServiceDescriptor</c>, <c>Configure</c> and <c>AddOptions</c>, reflection, framework
///         defaults, and registration helpers compiled into a package, which leave no source to read.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The two type names are fully qualified in the same form <see cref="TypeNode.FullName" /> takes,
///         so either compares equal to a declared type's name. An open generic is recorded as its
///         definition, so <c>AddSingleton(typeof(IRepo&lt;&gt;), typeof(Repo&lt;&gt;))</c> records
///         <c>IRepo&lt;T&gt;</c> and <c>Repo&lt;T&gt;</c>.
///     </para>
/// </remarks>
// Service and implementation are carried as fully-qualified name strings, never as TypeNode instances and
// never denormalized onto the type model: registration is many-to-many, so arch.Registered membership is
// resolved at evaluation against these facts (GRAMMAR §4.7).
