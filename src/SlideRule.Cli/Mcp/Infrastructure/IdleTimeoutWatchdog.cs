///     Defensive idle-timeout shutdown, complementing <see cref="ParentProcessWatcher" />.

///     SLIDERULE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES of inactivity.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     When an MCP client drops/recreates a connection abnormally without closing this
///     server's stdin pipe and the watched parent PID stays alive, the SDK's stdin-EOF
///     detection is missed and the server orphans; this is the backstop for that case.
///     Timed on Stopwatch, which on Windows reads QueryPerformanceCounter and so counts
///     time the machine spends asleep, and on Linux and macOS reads a monotonic clock
///     that stops while the machine is suspended. On Windows a suspend longer than the
///     timeout therefore ends the server at the first poll after wake, the same exit an
///     idle server makes; elsewhere the idle time resumes where the suspend stopped it.
///     A call in flight never counts as idle; a server that never receives a call still
///     exits, timed from process start.
///     SLIDERULE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=0 disables; unset/blank/invalid => the 30 min default
///     (a config typo must not silently remove leak protection — 0 is the only opt-out).
