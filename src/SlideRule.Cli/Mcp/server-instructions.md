SlideRule exposes this codebase's architecture spec — one reified model, enforced and explained. Five read-only tools:

- `arch_check` — the spec's verdict as a JSON report. Call before finishing work that touched architecture-relevant code; narrow with `rules` globs.
- `arch_status` — the migration burndown: per-rule grandfathered/stale counts and promotion suggestions.
- `arch_explain` — a rule's because / fix / posture; or, given `type` or `path`, who claims a type and why.
- `arch_context` — the scope card(s) covering a path. Call before editing an unfamiliar directory to learn its rules or whether it is dragon territory.
- `arch_graph` — the codebase survey: projects, namespace inventories, reference edges, who declares what. Needs no spec — orient on an unfamiliar solution or plan new rules; narrow with `overview` or `projects`.

One prompt, `derive_spec` — the onboarding recipe to run when spec resolution reports no spec project yet.

- Violations are data, not errors — a red rule is a finding, never a tool failure.
- Documents are the CLI verbs' `--json` output byte for byte: camelCase, optional fields absent not null, check entries keyed by `id` (`ruleId` is SARIF-only).
- Over the client budget `arch_check`/`arch_graph` coarsen their own grain; narrow with `rules`/`projects`, never page.
- The server is bound to one solution + one spec at start; the tools take no solution argument.
- The first call loads the workspace — seconds on a large solution — then it stays warm, reconciled per call. The server never builds: build first or results are stale.
- A failed load or restore makes the model wrong, not smaller: `arch_graph` errors naming them (build/restore precondition); `arch_check`/`arch_status` stamp `modelIncomplete: true` + `failedProjects`/`restoreFailedProjects` — report that, never plain green. Smaller, not wrong: `uncheckedProjects` (a filter), `unsupportedProjects` (not surveyed).
- Drill down with `arch_explain <rule-id>`; the always-on summary lives in the root `AGENTS.md` managed block.
