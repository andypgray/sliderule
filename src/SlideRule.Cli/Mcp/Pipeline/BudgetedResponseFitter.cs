/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         It walks the whole ladder rather than stepping once, because one step is not enough on a real
///         codebase: on a 34-project solution the full survey is ~147k characters and the overview it
///         degrades to is still ~82k, over any default budget. Stopping there hands

///         Past the last rung it returns that rung anyway: a document still over budget at its coarsest grain
///         lands on the truncator like any other response.

///     <para>
///         The budget is read once per <see cref="Fit" /> — that is, once per tool call — and the rungs are

///         serialization.
