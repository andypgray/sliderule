/// <summary>
///     The CLI's half of the check core over a <see cref="CodebaseSource" />, reused by <c>check</c> and
///     <c>status</c>: pick the rules, name the two things only the host can supply — how to extract this
///     run's codebase, and which files changed (as the caller listed them, or since the run's
///     <c>--diff-base</c>) — and hand them to <see cref="ArchCheckSequence" />, which owns the order they run
///     in. The two commands differ only in how they render the resulting <see cref="CheckReport" /> and their
///     exit codes — <c>check</c> gates, <c>status</c> reports (and passes no diff base, so its tripwires skip).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Both fail-fast preconditions — a tampered baseline, an unresolvable <c>--diff-base</c> — precede
///     <see cref="CodebaseSource.ExtractAsync" />, which is why extraction goes down as a delegate rather
///     than as an already-extracted model: the ordering is <see cref="ArchCheckSequence" />'s to hold, and it
///     holds whether the extraction is a cheap cache-hit merge or a full cold workspace walk.
///     <see cref="SelectRules" /> is earlier still, and separated from <see cref="ExecuteAsync" /> for that
///     reason — rule IDs are a property of the spec model, which is already in hand, so an unmatched filter
///     must never cost a codebase walk to refuse.
