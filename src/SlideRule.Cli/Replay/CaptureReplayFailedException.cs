/// <summary>
///     Thrown by <see cref="LazyCaptureReplaySource" /> when a capture that
///     <see cref="Roslyn.Replay.BinlogCaptureStore" />
///     validated as usable nonetheless fails to replay at runtime — a torn copy, a reference that vanished
///     between validation and materialisation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     It is caught only at the gate, which prints its <see cref="System.Exception.Message" /> (already the
///     complete notice) behind a <c>warning: </c> prefix and re-runs the command cold.
///     Never reaches <see cref="CliErrorMapper" />: this is a recoverable fallback signal, not a user error,
///     and acquisition precedes all rendering so the re-run produces the run's only output.
/// </remarks>
