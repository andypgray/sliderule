///     The eager replay source: serves a <see cref="Solution" /> the gate has <em>already</em>
///     replayed from an explicit <c>--binlog</c>, so the ingest sanity-check and capture persistence fire
///     deterministically before the run — even when the fragment cache would hit and never acquire a

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Hands back a non-owning handle (<c>owned: null</c>): the gate owns the underlying
///     <see cref="Roslyn.Replay.ReplayedSolution" /> and disposes it once the run completes. No
///     MSBuildWorkspace and no design-time build — the whole point of the bypass (the gate registers
///     MSBuildLocator up front so the binlog parser can resolve its MSBuild assemblies).
