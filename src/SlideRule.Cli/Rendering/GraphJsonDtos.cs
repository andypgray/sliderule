// The wire shape of `graph --json` — the pre-spec codebase survey, its own document with its own
// schemaVersion (GraphJsonRenderer.SchemaVersion), distinct from check and status. Serialized camelCase,
// indented, nulls omitted. Grouped counts only, never per-site dumps (the minimal-token posture); sites come
// later from `check`. The optional slots below — grain, projectsScope, the coverage statements, and the
// workspace ones — are additive and null (omitted) on a full, unscoped survey of an all-C# solution whose
// load raised nothing, whose NuGet packages resolved and that no solution filter narrowed, so the schema
// version does not move and the default document is byte-identical to the one before they existed. A run
// whose model is incomplete reaches this document only under --allow-workspace-diagnostics, since graph
// otherwise refuses before extraction.
//
// multiplyDeclaredTypes and shadowedTypes are coverage statements about the survey's contents, so they
// elide to counts at skeleton grain; unsupportedProjects is one about its subject, so it rides the trust
// stamp instead and is elided at no grain.
