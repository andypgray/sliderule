///     Pure over the report (no workspace), so the line shapes are unit-pinned.
///     With no ratcheted rule in the spec it owns the whole survey line — "nothing to do." when nothing
///     is failing, "nothing to capture." plus the notice when something is; beside ratchet work it
///     appends the notice alone, and it stays silent when every failure is ratcheted.
