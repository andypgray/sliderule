// The wire shape of `check --json` (its schemaVersion is JsonReportRenderer.SchemaVersion), pinned by a
// golden test. Serialized camelCase, indented, nulls omitted. Clustered in one file: these records are one
// cohesive DTO, not product types.
// The version moves only for a change of shape. A slot that is null on every run with nothing to say — a
// kind-specific member or project slot, a ratchet measure at zero, a trust stamp for a workspace that loaded
// whole and unfiltered, the `grain` of a full-grain report — is omitted, so a document that needs none of
// them is byte-identical to one written before the slot existed; and a widened enum (`caution`,
// `cautionedScopeTouched`) is a value a consumer meets, not a new shape. The per-rule `violationCount` and
// per-violation `siteCount` are unconditional at every grain, each declared ahead of the array it
// summarizes. Declaration order IS the wire order (System.Text.Json writes it verbatim), and CheckJson's is
// a deliberate ranking: the request echo, then the trust stamps, then `summary`, then `rules`, with
// `packageAudit` and then `workspaceDiagnostics` last — a stamp never arrives after the counts it
// invalidates, and a downstream cut lands in the bulk rather than on the roll-up.
