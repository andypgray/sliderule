///     available, so the next command is one edit away. Each caller keeps its own lead; the shape they share
///     lives here, as does the label-plus-roster pairing the two rule-ID refusals share and the ordinal sort

///     <see cref="StringifiedArrayRefusal" /> owns that decision, so a caller states only its lead, its
///     advice, and the roster it falls back to. The refusals are shared by the CLI and the MCP tools by
