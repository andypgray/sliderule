///     The base of every verb that fronts the persisted extraction cache, and everything that follows from
///     it: the <see cref="IEnvironment" /> seam the cache root is read through, and the observables a test
///     reads to learn which path a run actually took.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The observables are deliberately kept symmetric across all of them rather than declared only where a
///     test happens to read them today: they say the same thing about the same seam, and a runner that
///     reported one but not the others would make "which path did this verb take" a question with several
///     different answers. They are never printed — stdout and stderr are byte-identical whichever path a
///     run takes, which is the whole claim the cache has to earn. What the base class does <em>not</em>
///     decide is the policy: each runner spells its own as the <c>noCache</c> argument it passes
///     <see cref="CodebaseSource.CreateWithSpecAsync" />, which is why <c>baseline</c> can front the cache
///     in one mode and refuse to in two.
