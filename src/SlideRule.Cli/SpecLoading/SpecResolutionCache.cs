///         <b>The generation is the grain, and it is the only sound one.</b> A
///         <see cref="Roslyn.WorkspaceSession" /> mints a fresh snapshot instance per changed document, so
///         keying on snapshot identity would miss on every call after a <c>.cs</c> edit, the repeated call
///         this cache exists for, and spare nothing. Everything resolution reads is structural: the project set,
///         their <c>.csproj</c> paths, their evaluated output paths, and the solution's declared membership.
///         None of it can change without a full reload, which bumps the generation; and the solution file
///         itself is one of the structural fingerprints the session's reconcile sweep stats, so a project
///         added to or removed from it arrives here as a miss. It is the same grain
///         <see cref="Roslyn.Sessions.SessionFragmentStore" /> already flushes on, for the same reason.

///         replays through <see cref="SpecResolver.Replay" />, the one owner the persisted extraction cache's
///         hit path also goes through — so a spec DLL that has since been rebuilt, moved or deleted answers
///         in the cold run's words rather than with a path recorded before it went. That is a per-call

///     <para>
///         <b>A prebuilt-DLL <c>--spec</c> never gets here.</b> The caller answers it first, exactly as the

///         <b>Successes only, and the expensive work stays outside the lock.</b> A resolution that throws —
///         no spec project, an ambiguous one, nothing built — stores nothing, so every later call re-raises
///         the identical error the cold CLI raises rather than replaying a stale success. Neither the full
///         resolve nor the replay's disk search runs under the gate, which would otherwise serialize every
///         tool call behind one solution's walk; two callers racing the same miss both resolve and the last
///         one recorded wins, which costs a walk and never a wrong answer.
