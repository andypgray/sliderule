/// <summary>
///     A session-scoped cache of loaded spec models, keyed by the spec DLL's file stamp. The warm MCP
///     server's answer to re-running the whole spec load — a fresh <see cref="SpecLoadContext" />, the DLL
///     re-read off disk, reflection over its types, the spec's own <c>Define()</c> executed, and a full
///     model build plus validation — on every single tool call, for something that changes only when the
///     spec project is rebuilt. The one-shot CLI keeps its per-process load untouched.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>The stamp is the whole contract.</b> A hit requires <see cref="FileFreshness.CanTrust" /> —
///         same existence, same mtime, same length, and the recorded stamp captured comfortably outside the
///         filesystem's racy window — which is the same primitive the warm workspace's reconcile sweep and
///         the persisted extraction cache already trust for staleness. A rebuilt spec therefore misses and
///         reloads, and a spec rebuilt inside the racy window keeps missing (and reloading) until its stamp
///         promotes, which is the safe direction to be wrong in.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Successes only.</b> A load that throws — a deleted DLL, a spec-validation failure, a
///         dependency that will not resolve — stores nothing, so every later call re-raises the identical
///         error the cold CLI raises rather than replaying a stale success or a cached exception.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>What this does to assembly-load-context lifetime: strictly less.</b> A collectible context
///         cannot actually collect while the model it produced roots the spec's <c>Type</c> references, so
///         caching the model keeps one such context alive instead of minting a new uncollectable one per
///         tool call. Nothing is loaded by path (<see cref="SpecLoadContext.LoadWithoutLocking" />), so no
///         build output is pinned either way.
