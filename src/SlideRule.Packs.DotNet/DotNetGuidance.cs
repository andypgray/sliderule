/// <summary>
///     Canonical .NET guidance as a rule pack: nine project-independent rules, one static method each,
///     declared on the <see cref="Arch" /> your spec is handed. A pack is an ordinary class library
///     with no plugin host and no discovery, so a rule lands only where a spec calls for it, and
///     opting out of one means not making the call. Taking a rule from here and also writing it
///     yourself is a duplicate rule ID, which is reported when the spec is loaded.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The pack owns each rule's reason and the canonical page it cites, because those are the
///         same in every codebase and you can override neither. You own the posture, the selections
///         the rule governs, the remediation hint and the type to copy: pass a replacement hint as the
///         <c>fix</c> argument and the type as the <c>exemplar</c> argument, since these methods return
///         nothing and leave no <c>.Fix(...)</c> or <c>.Exemplar(...)</c> to chain.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A method's name is the rule-name half of its ID, PascalCased with the area dropped
///         (<c>http/reuse-httpclient</c> is <see cref="ReuseHttpClient" />), so the mapping needs no
///         table.
///     </para>
/// </remarks>
// Anchor doctrine: every member anchor here is written arch.Member(typeof(X), nameof(X.M)), never
// the expression form. This pack ships inside a codebase it governs, and an expression anchor is
// real syntax — it would mint a use edge attributed to this type and make the pack a violator of
// its own rules. nameof operands mint nothing, and the two forms reify identically (GRAMMAR §13),
// so the doctrine costs nothing.
