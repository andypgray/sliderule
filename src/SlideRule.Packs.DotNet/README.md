# SlideRule.Packs.DotNet

`SlideRule.Packs.DotNet` is a rule pack: nine canonical .NET rules as an ordinary class
library, so a spec that wants them does not write them again. There is no plugin host, no
manifest, and no discovery. You reference the project and call the methods you want.

This project is not published. It ships inside this repository as a working example and as the
pack three of the repository's own specs consume.

## Taking a rule

```csharp
using SlideRule;
using SlideRule.Packs.DotNet;

public sealed class MyArchitectureSpec : IArchitectureSpec
{
    public void Define(Arch arch)
    {
        Selection host = arch.Namespace("MyApp.Host.*");

        DotNetGuidance.ReuseHttpClient(arch, arch.Types, host, PackPosture.Enforce);

        DotNetGuidance.AsyncSuffix(arch, arch.Types.InNamespace("MyApp.*"),
            PackPosture.Migrate("Repository methods return Task without the Async suffix."));
    }
}
```

Add a `ProjectReference` to this project alongside the one to `SlideRule`. Also set
`<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>`. The checker loads a spec through
a resolver rooted at the spec's own DLL. Staging the pack's package dependencies beside it makes
that resolution independent of what the checking machine has restored. Note where the failure would
land if the setting is missing — at check time, not at build time.

A `typeof()` anchor on a **.NET shared framework** type is the one case no build setting reaches.
An ASP.NET Core or WPF type arriving through `<FrameworkReference>` is never staged into a class
library's output. Anchor those by string (`.DerivedFrom("Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase")`,
which renders identically) rather than by `typeof()`.

## The nine rules

| Method | Rule ID | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| `ReuseHttpClient` | `http/reuse-httpclient` | nothing outside the composition root constructs an `HttpClient` |
| `NoServiceLocator` | `di/no-service-locator` | nothing outside the resolve seam resolves from an `IServiceProvider` |
| `NoBuildServiceProvider` | `di/no-buildserviceprovider` | nothing builds a second container while configuring services |
| `NoSyncOverAsync` | `async/no-sync-over-async` | nothing blocks on a `Task` or a `ValueTask` |
| `NoCaptiveDependencies` | `di/no-captive-dependencies` | singletons inject nothing scoped or transient |
| `AsyncSuffix` | `naming/async-suffix` | authored `Task`/`ValueTask`-returning methods carry the `Async` suffix |
| `NoGeneralCatch` | `exceptions/no-general-catch` | only the top-level handler swallows base `Exception` |
| `AcceptCancellation` | `async/accept-cancellation` | authored `Task`/`ValueTask`-returning methods accept a `CancellationToken` |
| `NoMappingAttributes` | `persistence/no-mapping-attributes` | persisted types carry no ORM mapping attribute |

The method name is the rule-name half of the ID, PascalCased with the area dropped, so the
mapping needs no table to use. Each method takes
`(Arch arch, Selection subject, …, PackPosture posture, string? fix = null, Selection? exemplar = null)`;
three of them take
one extra `Selection` naming a seam (`compositionRoot`, `resolveSeam`, `topLevelHandler`).

## What the pack owns, and what you own

The pack owns `Because` and `Citation`. The reason to reuse an `HttpClient` is the same in every
codebase, and so is the page that says so. Both ship with the rule, and you can override neither.
If a rule's rationale is different for you, that is a signal to write the rule yourself instead of
taking it.

You own the posture. Pass `PackPosture.Enforce` for law, or
`PackPosture.Migrate("<what the code does today>")` for a ratchet against a baseline. The same rule
is `Enforce` in a codebase that already keeps it and `Migrate` in one working it off. The pack
has never seen your code and does not guess. Baseline paths stay conventional, so the pack never
names a path.

You own the selections: which types the rule governs, and which seam is exempt.

You may override `Fix`. Remediation names local types, and the pack's generic hint cannot.
Pass it as the `fix` argument, not as a `.Fix(...)` trailer. Pack methods return `void`, so exactly
one `Because`, one `Citation` and one `Fix` reach the rule and a second trailer will not compile.

You may also name the type to copy. Pass a selection as the `exemplar` argument, such as
`exemplar: arch.Types.Named("CarrierClient")`. `check` resolves it like any rule's exemplar,
prints where the type is declared beneath a failed rule, and warns when no type matches it.

## Sharing a definition without taking the rule

Sometimes the rule is yours and only the list is the pack's. This repository's own
`mcp/no-blocking-waits` bans the same members as `async/no-sync-over-async`, but its reason names
what a block costs inside a long-lived MCP server and its subject exempts one type by name. Neither
of those is something a consumer can pass to a pack method, so the rule is written locally.

`BlockingWaitAnchors` hands that member set back for a local rule to ban. You keep the ID, the
posture, the selections, the reason and the fix; the pack keeps one definition of what blocking on
a task means, so a member added to it is added to both rules at once.

```csharp
Selection host = arch.Namespace("MyApp.Host.*");
(Member blockingWait, Member[] moreBlockingWaits) = DotNetGuidance.BlockingWaitAnchors(arch);

arch.Rule("host/no-blocking-waits")
    .Enforce(host
        .Except(arch.Types.Named("ShutdownDrain"))
        .MustNotUse(blockingWait, moreBlockingWaits))
    .Because("A blocking wait in the request path holds a thread for the whole call and drops the " +
             "CancellationToken, so a client cancel leaves the work running.")
    .Fix("Await the call and flow the CancellationToken.");
```

The set arrives split because `MustNotUse` takes one member and the rest, not because the first one
differs from the others. It is the only export of this kind in the pack today.

## Opting out, and colliding

Opting out is not calling the method. There is no suppression mechanism and no severity dial,
because a rule you did not ask for cannot arrive.

Taking a rule from the pack **and** writing it yourself is a duplicate ID, which fails the spec
build with both sites reported. That is deliberate. Rule IDs are the baseline key and the
`explain` handle, so one loud error beats two quiet reports of the same law under different names.
It is also why the pack uses no ID prefix.

## `ApplyAll`

`ApplyAll` declares all nine at one posture, with no `Fix` overrides. Its only consumer is the
test that proves the pack's full surface in one call. No real spec wants all nine at the same
posture over the same subject; name the ones you mean.

## Anchor doctrine

Every member anchor in this pack is written `arch.Member(typeof(X), nameof(X.M))`, never the
expression form. The pack ships inside a codebase its own rules govern, and an expression anchor
is real syntax. `arch.Member<IServiceProvider>(sp => sp.GetService(...))` would mint a use edge
attributed to `DotNetGuidance` and make the pack a violator of `di/no-service-locator`. A `nameof`
operand mints nothing, and both forms reify to the same anchor, so the doctrine costs nothing.

A test pins it by reading this project's source, so the rule survives a reformat.
