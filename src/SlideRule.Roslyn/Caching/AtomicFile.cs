///     file in the target's own directory, are flushed to disk, and the temp is then
///     <see cref="File.Move(string,string,bool)" />d over the target. A reader never sees a half-written file;
///     a crash mid-write leaves either the intact old file or the intact new one — never a truncated one; and,
///     because the flush persists the bytes before the rename, a power loss in the move window cannot leave the
///     renamed target pointing at content still sitting unwritten in the OS cache. The unique temp name (not a
///     fixed <c>.tmp</c>) lets two writers of the same target coexist without clobbering each other's scratch
///     file.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Failure semantics are deliberate: this <em>throws</em> rather than swallowing to a bool, because a
///     silently-dropped write to a user-owned, version-controlled file would be a lie. A caller persisting
///     disposable derived data — which is simply rebuilt next run — wraps this and re-swallows the throw
///     itself. The temp file is deleted on the failure path.
///     Lives in the Roslyn (net10.0) project because the overwriting
///     <see cref="File.Move(string,string,bool)" /> overload does not exist on Core's netstandard2.0.
