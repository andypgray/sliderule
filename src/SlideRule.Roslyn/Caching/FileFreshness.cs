///     A file's recorded freshness fingerprint: whether it existed, its last-write time and its byte length
///     at the moment of capture, plus the instant of the capture itself. Take one with
///     <see cref="Capture" /> or <see cref="CaptureUnverified" />, then ask <see cref="MatchesStat" /> or
///     <see cref="CanTrust" /> whether a fresh capture of the same path still matches. It knows how to stat
///     a path and how to reason about the window in which a timestamp cannot be trusted; what to do about a
///     mismatch is the caller's business.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         Filesystems record last-write times coarsely (the FAT/exFAT floor is two seconds, while NTFS is far finer),
///         so a fingerprint captured within <see cref="RacyWindow" /> of the file's own timestamp cannot prove the file
///         is unchanged: a write in the same tick would share that timestamp. Such a fingerprint stays unpromoted
///         (<see cref="IsPromoted" /> is false) until it has been checked against the file's content once and captured
///         again comfortably outside the window. That is the difference between the two comparisons:
///         <see cref="CanTrust" /> insists on it and <see cref="MatchesStat" /> does not.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Any difference in timestamp counts as a change, including one that moved backwards: a timestamp-preserving
///         restore is a difference, not proof of freshness. <see cref="Length" /> catches a change that put the
///         recorded timestamp back exactly. One case gets past both: equal timestamp, equal length and different
///         content, on an already-promoted file. Nothing here watches the filesystem, so it takes the caller's next
///         wholesale reload, or its next run, to pick such a change up.
