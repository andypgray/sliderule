/// <summary>
///     The persisted extraction cache as a single serializable document: a self-describing manifest plus
///     every <see cref="CodebaseFragment" /> the last workspace-loaded run extracted. One
///     <see cref="ExtractionCacheStore" /> reads, validates, and (re)writes exactly one of these to one
///     atomic file. The manifest is deliberately self-contained — it records every input
///     path and its stamp so validation needs no MSBuild and no <see cref="CodebaseFragment" /> inspection.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The stamps are the manifest's own rather than <see cref="FileFreshness" />: a stamp is durable on-disk
///         data; <see cref="FileFreshness.RecordedAtUtc" /> is a runtime notion (the wall-clock instant of a
///         capture) that has no meaning across process boundaries. So the racy-window decision is frozen at
///         write time into <see cref="FileStamp.Promoted" /> instead, and validation reconstitutes a
///         <see cref="FileFreshness" /> only for the pure stat comparison (<see cref="FileFreshness.MatchesStat" />).

///     The absolute <c>.csproj</c> paths the recorded run did not check — non-empty only when it went
///     through a solution filter. Persisted for the same reason as <see cref="FailedProjects" /> and no

///     file at all) are still on disk, but it must not be: a hit means every one of those paths stamped

///     The projects the solution declared that no extractor reached on the recorded run, each with the
