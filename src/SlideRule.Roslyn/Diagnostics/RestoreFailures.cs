///     <para>
///         The verdict is a file read, never a diagnostic parse. A failed restore does write
///         <c>project.assets.json</c> (measured), with the failure recorded in its <c>logs</c> array as a
///         <c>{ "code": …, "level": … }</c> pair whose fields are invariant across UI languages, so a project
///         whose assets file carries a non-audit <c>level: Error</c> entry failed its restore, in any locale.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The candidate paths come from <see cref="IntermediateOutputTree.AssetsPathsOf" />, the same primitive
///         the cache stamps, so the file this reads and the file that invalidates the cache are the same file. The
///         first candidate that exists wins, so a shallower shared intermediate root cannot shadow a project's own
///         file.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A bad read is not a failure: every degradation (unreadable file, malformed JSON, an unexpected node
///         kind, an unknown layout) answers "not failed", because the alternative is refusing a healthy solution.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         No assets file at all asserts nothing on its own, since a non-SDK-style .NET Framework project never
///         writes one, and asserts "the restore never ran" for an SDK-style project, which writes one on every
///         restore and still loads completely without one. So absence is read together with
///         <see cref="SdkStyleProject.IsSdkStyle" />, and only the SDK-style project is blamed. The residual limit:
///         a non-SDK-style project using <c>PackageReference</c> that was never restored stays invisible, because
///         its absent assets file cannot be told from a <c>packages.config</c> project's.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The NuGet audit family (NU19xx) is excluded by code even where <c>TreatWarningsAsErrors</c>
///         promoted it to <c>level: Error</c>; any <em>other</em> promoted warning gates, deliberately —
///         restore exited non-zero by the operator's own configuration of their own dependency graph.
