///     Where a project's intermediate (<c>obj</c>-side) tree is, and where the restore assets file inside it

///     assumes. Shared by the spec resolver's built-output search, which must never return an intermediate
///     assembly, and by every probe and reader of the assets file, which must find it wherever the layout in
///     force actually writes it.

///     <para>
///         <b>Why derived rather than spelled.</b> The default layout puts the assets file at
///         <c>&lt;projectDirectory&gt;/obj/project.assets.json</c>. <c>UseArtifactsOutput</c> puts it at
///         <c>&lt;artifacts&gt;/obj/&lt;Project&gt;/project.assets.json</c> — outside the project directory
///         entirely — and a redirected <c>BaseIntermediateOutputPath</c> puts it anywhere. A probe that
///         spells the default layout finds nothing under the others, and an absent probe is not a quiet
///         degradation: it is a structural input the cache stops watching, so a restore that changes the
///         model is served from cache as though nothing moved (measured in field testing, not read off
///         the code).

///         build pivots — configuration, target framework, runtime identifier — and how many there are is
///         the layout's business, not this code's: the default layout puts the assets file three levels
///         above the assembly and the artifacts layout one. Every directory on that walk is therefore
///         stamped, absent ones included, which is what makes an assets file that appears on a later restore
///         an existence flip rather than a file nobody was watching. The extras are absent-file stats, the
///         same cheap shape the props/targets probe chain already relies on.
