///         <b>Canonicalizing probes the filesystem for a reparse point at every path segment</b>, and the
///         projects of one solution share nearly all of theirs — so a walk that resolves each
///         <c>.csproj</c> from scratch pays that whole chain once per project, and a large solution's
///         resolution turns into hundreds of syscalls for an answer that barely varies. The directory half
///         is memoized and the leaf name reattached, which is the same answer for every path whose leaf is
///         not itself a reparse point.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>And when the leaf is one, the full resolve runs anyway.</b> A <c>.csproj</c> that is a symlink
///         follows through <see cref="System.IO.FileSystemInfo.ResolveLinkTarget" /> exactly as a directory
///         does — measured, not assumed — so reattaching the leaf name would answer with the link's own path
///         where <see cref="PathCanonicalizer.Resolve" /> answers with its target's. Both sides of a
///         declared-membership test have to agree on one spelling or a declared project reads as a
///         passenger, so the equivalence here is exact rather than nearly: one probe on the leaf buys it,
///         against a chain of them saved.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         One instance per walk, never shared and never static. The memo records what the filesystem said
///         at one instant, and the callers each already decide how fresh their view of disk has to be; a
///         memo that outlived a walk would answer for a tree that has since moved.
