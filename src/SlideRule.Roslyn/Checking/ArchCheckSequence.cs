/// <summary>
///     The check sequence, in one place: load the ratcheted baselines, resolve the optional diff context,
///     extract the codebase, evaluate the rules. Both surfaces that check a spec run this — the CLI's
///     <c>check</c>/<c>status</c> pipeline and the xUnit adapter — so the ordering they both depend on is
///     enforced here rather than restated in each and enforced in neither.

/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>Fail-fast precedes extraction.</b> A tampered baseline file, and a <c>--diff-base</c> ref that
///         does not resolve, must fail the run <em>before</em> the Roslyn walk it would otherwise pay for.
///         Both arrive as work this type schedules rather than as work a caller has already done: extraction
///         is a delegate so the ordering survives whatever a caller's extraction costs (a cache-hit fragment
///         merge, a warm session's incremental re-walk, or a cold workspace load the delegate performs
///         itself), and the diff is a delegate for the same reason — it shells out to git, which is a
///         precondition to check, not a cost to pay twice.
