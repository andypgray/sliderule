/// <summary>
///     An error whose message is meant to be shown to the person who ran the tool, complete on its own, such
///     as an unreadable solution filter or a baseline file that has been tampered with. Throw it when the
///     fault is something the reader can fix; anything else is a bug and should surface as itself.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Both of SlideRule's own hosts treat it that way: the CLI prints the message alone to stderr and exits 2, and
///     the MCP server returns it to the client as an error result. Any other exception is treated as a bug instead: the
///     CLI writes its whole stack trace, and the MCP server logs it once as a warning.
