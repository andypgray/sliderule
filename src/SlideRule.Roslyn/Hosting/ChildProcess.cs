/// <summary>
///     The one child-process launcher in this repository. It starts a process with all three
///     standard streams redirected, hands it a stdin it closes immediately, captures stdout and stderr,
///     and bounds the whole thing: on expiry it kills the process tree rather than waiting on.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why stdin is always redirected and then closed.</b> A child started with
///         <c>UseShellExecute=false</c> and no stdin redirection inherits a duplicate of the parent's
///         stdin handle. Inside the MCP server that handle is the client's live JSON-RPC pipe, and the
///         stdio transport is permanently parked on it in a synchronous read; Git for Windows probes its
///         standard handles at startup, and that probe blocks forever against a pipe with outstanding
///         synchronous I/O. The child then never reaches its own entry point, the caller waits out the
///         whole timeout, and the tool call fails 100% of the time — invisibly to any test that runs the
///         same code in-process. Handing every child its own stdin pipe, closed before it can matter,
///         removes the inheritance entirely. It also makes a child that branches on "is stdin a
///         terminal?" answer the same way under a test runner as under a real client.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>What the bound actually bounds.</b> Not the reads. On Windows
///         <see cref="Process.StandardOutput" /> wraps a <em>synchronous</em> <c>FileStream</c>, so a
///         <see cref="CancellationToken" /> handed to <c>ReadToEndAsync</c> cannot interrupt a read that
///         is already in flight — the token bounds the wait for exit and nothing else. Three things
///         together are what keep a caller from hanging: the closed stdin, so the child cannot wedge at
///         startup; the bounded wait for exit; and the kill-tree on expiry, because killing the child
///         closes its write ends, which is what lets the blocked reads complete with EOF a moment later.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Two arms.</b> <see cref="RunAsync" /> is the default and flows the caller's token, so a
///         cancelled tool call aborts its child instead of leaving a zombie to run out the clock.
///         <see cref="Run" /> exists for the one caller that cannot be asynchronous — the vswhere probe
///         sits inside the MSBuild registration path's JIT quarantine — and blocks on nothing: it drains
///         through the event-based readers and waits on the process handle, never on a
///         <see cref="Task" />. Its capture is line-oriented as a result (LF-normalized, one trailing
///         newline per line read), which the async arm's <c>ReadToEnd</c> capture is not.
