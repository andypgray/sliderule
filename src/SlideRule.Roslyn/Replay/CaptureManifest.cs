///     the binlog copy.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Why the capture keys on structure alone, and why a manifest it cannot read degrades rather than

/// <param name="ToolVersion">
///     The writing tool's informational version (per-commit during development); a mismatch invalidates the

/// <param name="StructuralStamps">
///     Full <see cref="FileStamp" />s (with SHA-256) of the solution file, every C# project's csproj, each

// are recorded for the same reason — they decide which structural paths the capture stamped, so a manifest
// diff that shows the stamps should show what produced them.
