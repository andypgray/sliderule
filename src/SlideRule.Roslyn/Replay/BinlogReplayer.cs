///     return. The replayed solution is the design-time-build bypass — it carries the structure the
///     build recorded (project files, output paths, references, the csc source-file list) while the
///     document text is read from <em>current disk state</em> at materialisation time, so edits made

///         <see cref="AdhocWorkspace" />, so — unlike <see cref="WorkspaceLoader" /> — it never opens an
///         <c>MSBuildWorkspace</c> and never spawns an out-of-process build host. It is <em>not</em> free of
///         MSBuild assemblies, though: the reader's binlog parser (MSBuild.StructuredLogger, pulled in by
///         <c>Basic.CompilerLog.Util</c>) binds <c>Microsoft.Build.Framework</c> at runtime, resolved through
///         the host's <c>MSBuildLocator</c> registration. That is a real constraint, not an
///         implementation detail to simplify away:
///         <b>a caller must register MSBuildLocator before replaying</b>, or the parser fails to load
///         <c>Microsoft.Build.Framework</c> at runtime.
