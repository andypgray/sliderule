///     A binlog-replayed solution paired with the in-memory workspace it was loaded into — the replay
///     analog of <see cref="LoadedSolution" />. <see cref="Solution" /> is the

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Unlike <see cref="LoadedSolution" /> there is no MSBuild <c>BuildHost</c> to release, because no
///     design-time build ran: the structure came from a real build's binlog and the source text is read
///     from current disk.
///     Owns two disposables: the <see cref="AdhocWorkspace" /> and the <see cref="SolutionReader" />
///     whose lazy per-document text loaders back the solution's source (and whose analyzer host holds
///     the on-disk analyzer assemblies). A Roslyn <see cref="Solution" /> outlives the workspace that
///     produced it — the same contract <see cref="LoadedSolution" /> keeps everywhere in this repo — so
///     callers may keep reading a <see cref="Solution" /> already materialised by extraction after
///     <see cref="Dispose" />; disposal only frees the workspace and reader resources.
