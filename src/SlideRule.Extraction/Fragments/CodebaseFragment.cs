namespace SlideRule.Extraction.Fragments;

/// <summary>
///     The extraction of one <see cref="CompilationInput" /> (one project, one target framework) as pure,
///     self-contained data. It holds no Roslyn types (no <c>ISymbol</c>, <c>Compilation</c>, or
///     <c>Location</c>) so it is System.Text.Json-serializable by design — the persisted extraction cache
///     stores exactly this — and <see cref="FragmentMerger.Merge" /> reconstructs a
///     <see cref="SlideRule.Codebase.CodebaseModel" /> from a set of fragments, reproducing the
///     global cross-input semantics.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         A single fragment is one compilation's <em>narrow view</em>: a type another project declares still
///         appears in its <see cref="Externals" /> (as metadata), and the merge — not the fragment — decides
///         unification. The fragment's own collections are materialized in a canonical order so serialization
///         is stable; global ordering is re-derived at merge, so a fragment's internal order never affects the
///         model.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="TargetFramework" /> sits beside <see cref="ProjectName" /> because it is the other half
///         of the same identity: where one project file yielded several compilations, the project name alone
///         no longer says which one a fact came from. It is <see langword="null" /> for the common
///         single-framework project, and the merge's framework-collapse note is gated on both sides being
///         known.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="SolutionMember" /> is the third identity fact and the one that is about the
///         <em>solution</em> rather than the compilation: whether the solution file declares this project, or
///         <see langword="null" /> where membership was never read. It trails the collections, and carries a
///         default, only so a hand-built fragment need not name a fact it has no way to know, for which
///         unknown is the correct answer.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="AssemblyName" /> is the fourth, and it is <em>not</em> <see cref="ProjectName" /> under
///         another name: the project name is the csproj's own file name, while this is what the compilation
///         emits, and an <c>&lt;AssemblyName&gt;</c> property or a renamed csproj parts them. The distinction
///         matters because this is the only string comparable against a
///         <see cref="FragmentExternal.AssemblyName" /> — the assembly some other fragment's compilation
///         actually bound a name to — which is how the merge tells a reference this project satisfied from one
///         a referenced assembly of the same full name satisfied. It carries a default for the same reason
///         <see cref="SolutionMember" /> does, and <see langword="null" /> is read as unknown throughout: an
///         unknown assembly never makes the merge conclude anything.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The trailing artifact facts are the fifth group, and the only ones that come from MSBuild rather
///         than from the compilation: what the project declares it targets, the packages it declares, whether
///         it packs, and whether its restore locks — each with the <c>file:line</c> that decided it, which is
///         regularly in a props file above the project. They carry defaults for
///         <see cref="SolutionMember" />'s reason and are read the same way: absent is unevaluated, never
///         off. <see cref="DeclaredTargetFrameworks" /> is <see cref="TargetFramework" />'s counterpart
///         rather than a longer spelling of it — this fragment is one framework's compilation, and that list
///         is every framework the project file names, which stays the same across the fragments of one
///         multi-targeted project.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="UndeclaredProjectReferences" /> trails them all but one: the projects this compilation
///         references that <see cref="ProjectReferences" /> does not account for, read beside the declarations,
///         and <see langword="null" /> or empty wherever there is nothing to report.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="Properties" /> is last: the properties this compilation's evaluation found the repository
///         setting, with the project file it read, and <see langword="null" /> wherever nothing evaluated it.
///     </para>
