///     member's declaring type by FQN, its simple name and <see cref="MemberKind" />, its stable
///     <see cref="MemberSymbolId">DocumentationCommentId</see>, and the distinct <c>file:line</c> sites
///     where the use occurs (in <see cref="FragmentSite" /> order, already same-type-filtered at
///     extraction). The merge unions site-sets across fragments per (source, member SymbolId) and rewires

///     <see cref="TargetContainingTypeFullName" />, <see cref="MemberName" />, and
///     <see cref="MemberKind" /> are all functions of the member symbol (never re-parsed from the DocID)
///     and are carried alongside <see cref="MemberSymbolId" /> so the merge can build the model node
///     without re-binding — the member analog of <see cref="FragmentEdge" /> plus the member's own facts.
///     The pure-data counterpart of <see cref="SlideRule.Codebase.MemberEdge" />.
