/// <summary>
///     The scalar facts of one declared member (GRAMMAR §4.6), extracted from a Roslyn symbol but holding
///     no Roslyn types — the member analog of <see cref="TypeFacts" /> and the pure-data payload the merge
///     turns into a <see cref="SlideRule.Codebase.MemberNode" />. Read once per member from the
///     declaring type's <c>OriginalDefinition</c> so a persisted fragment rebuilds the
///     inventory without re-binding.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="Kind" /> and <see cref="Accessibility" /> are the Core enums (never Roslyn's), so
///         this record — like the rest of the fragment DTO — carries no dependency on
///         <c>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis</c> and round-trips through System.Text.Json unchanged.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The flags carry C# declaration semantics, not IL: <see cref="IsVirtual" /> is true for a
///         <c>virtual</c> member and false for an <c>override</c> or <c>abstract</c> one;
///         <see cref="IsAbstract" /> is true for an <c>abstract</c> member and for every interface member
///         without a body (a default implementation is virtual instead);
///         <see cref="IsOverride" /> reads the member's own <c>override</c> keyword and <see cref="IsSealed" />
///         is true for a <c>sealed override</c> alone, so a member of a sealed class is not sealed;
///         <see cref="IsAsync" /> reflects the <c>async</c> keyword. Exactly one of
///         <see cref="ReturnTypeFullName" /> (methods; <c>System.Void</c> for a void method) and
///         <see cref="MemberTypeFullName" /> (properties/fields/events) is non-null; both are the
///         definition-level FQN in extraction format, so a method's <see cref="ReturnTypeFullName" />
///         compares equal to the <c>.Returning</c> anchor's <c>TypeName.FullDisplay</c> (GRAMMAR §4.6).
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="Parameters" /> is the method's declared parameters in declaration order — each a
///         <see cref="ParameterFacts" /> whose type is normalized by the same helper as
///         <see cref="ReturnTypeFullName" /> (GRAMMAR §4.6, §5.6). It is empty for properties, fields, and
///         events, and for a parameterless method.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <see cref="Attributes" /> is the member's <em>declared</em> attributes as definition/constructed
///         name pairs — the <see cref="FragmentConstruction" /> record reused verbatim from the type side, so
///         a generic attribute's definition and its construction are both carried (GRAMMAR §4.6). Ordered
///         ordinal by <see cref="FragmentConstruction.ConstructedName" />, and empty when the member declares
///         none.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The mutability facts are kind-scoped the same way (GRAMMAR §4.6): <see cref="HasSetter" /> and
///         <see cref="HasInitOnlySetter" /> are read off a property's setter accessor and are false for every
///         other kind; <see cref="IsReadOnly" /> and <see cref="IsConst" /> off a field's declaration and are
///         false for every other kind. <see cref="HasInitOnlySetter" /> implies <see cref="HasSetter" /> — an
///         init-only setter is a setter, so the pair refines rather than competes. <see cref="IsReadOnly" />
///         and <see cref="IsConst" /> are disjoint: a <c>const</c> field is not <c>readonly</c> in C#
///         declaration semantics, so a reader after "cannot be reassigned" has to take both.
///     </para>
