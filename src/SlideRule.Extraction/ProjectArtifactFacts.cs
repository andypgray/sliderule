/// <summary>
///     What one evaluation of one project file said about the artifact it builds: the frameworks it
///     declares, the packages it declares, whether it packs, and whether its restore locks — each paired
///     with the <c>file:line</c> that decided it. It also names the project files the project declares a
///     reference to.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         One value per <em>compilation</em>, not per project file: a multi-targeted project is evaluated
///         once per framework, because a condition on <c>$(TargetFramework)</c> can add a package to one
///         framework and not another, and an outer-build evaluation would see neither. The merge folds the
///         per-framework values back into one project.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Absence of the whole value means no evaluation happened. Absence <em>inside</em> it means
///         something narrower and is documented per member, because the two spellings of "no" are not the
///         same fact: an undeclared <c>RestorePackagesWithLockFile</c> genuinely says restore does not lock,
///         while an undefined <c>IsPackable</c> says this project is outside the machinery that would answer.
