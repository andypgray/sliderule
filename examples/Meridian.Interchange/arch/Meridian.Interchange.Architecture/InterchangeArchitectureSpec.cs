/// <summary>
///     The interchange subsystem's architecture spec — Meridian's outbound worker that drains an
///     outbox and transmits booking confirmations, status updates, and customs filings to trading
///     partners over HTTP. Its rules encode canonical Microsoft .NET guidance, and the one legacy
///     manifest corner that still blocks on async work is grandfathered until its gateway goes async.
///     <para>
///         Nine of the twelve rules are canonical .NET guidance with nothing specific to this subsystem,
///         so they come from the shared <c>DotNetGuidance</c> pack. The pack supplies each rule's
///         <c>Because</c>, and this spec chooses the posture and the selections. Four of the nine override
///         the <c>Fix</c> where the remedy needs local detail, and three name an <c>Exemplar</c>, a type
///         that already shows the fix (<c>CarrierClient</c>, <c>ScopedDispatchRunner</c>,
///         <c>OutboxProcessor</c>). The other three rules name domain types and are written here.

// This example's README quotes rules from the class below as they are written here, continuation
// columns included, and the compiled spec is the same whichever way they are laid out. The marker
// holds the formatter off everything after it, so the shape a reader meets here is the shape they
// meet there, and the file still goes through cleanup with the rest of the tree, with no exception
// to remember. It is unbalanced on purpose: the quoted blocks sit throughout Define.
// Where a quote writes the `interchange` local out in place, it is not a substring of this file and no
// test holds it, so a change to that rule is copied to the README by hand.
