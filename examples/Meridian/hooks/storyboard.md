# Agent-loop storyboard: the rule that corrects the agent

A coding agent, working a routine task, writes something the architecture rules do not allow, and
the rule reaches it before the turn ends, so the agent self-corrects before the work is handed
back. This page walks that loop beat by beat, then walks the other half of it: an edit the rules
allow, into code the spec has marked as dangerous, where the hook informs rather than blocks.

The agent's code, its words, and Claude Code's line are quoted from the session transcripts as
captured. The check output is re-run. This repository's tests make the agent's edit in memory, check
it with the current tool, and fail when a report below stops matching what that check prints.
Nothing here is mocked, and [Reproduce it](#reproduce-it) walks the same loop at the command line.

**How it was captured (2026-09-09).** Two `claude -p` runs against this repository with a `Stop`
and a `SubagentStop` hook wired and nothing else, both given the Beat 1 brief and one steer: follow
the prevailing data-access style of the other controllers. Beats 2 to 4 are the Haiku 4.5 run; Beat
5 is the Opus run. What neither run did is written into Beat 2, because it is the more interesting
half of the result. The Opus run's context also carried the seven rules that passed, which the tool
now leaves out. Both runs wired the wrapper script that `sliderule hook` has since replaced, which
is why Claude Code's line in Beat 3 names it. The wrapper ran the same check and answered with the
same exit codes.

## The file in this directory

The repository does not commit `.claude/` (it is a local dev aid), so the hook config lives here
as a paste-in rather than a live `.claude/` folder. Lift it into your own repo:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`settings.snippet.json`](settings.snippet.json) | Paste into your `.claude/settings.json`: a `UserPromptSubmit` entry, a `Stop` entry and a `SubagentStop` twin, each running `sliderule hook`, plus four deny rules that keep `baseline` a human decision. |

The snippet is the Meridian instantiation of SlideRule's agent-hook recipe. Each entry names
Meridian's solution, because this repository's own `sliderule.json` names another, and the hook
finds Meridian's spec by convention. The one thing the hook has to get right is the exit code:
a clean check returns 0 and the turn ends; a red rule returns 2, which is how a Claude Code hook
refuses a stop, carrying the violation report on stderr so the agent reads it and fixes the code;
SlideRule's own errors return 1, a config problem the user sees rather than an architecture
violation the agent is told to fix. Returning 0 is not the same as saying nothing: where the check
warned, the hook hands the report back as hook context, which is Beat 5.

## Beat 1: the task

> Add a lookup endpoint to `BookingsController` that returns a booking by its reference, or 404
> when there is no such booking.

`BookingsController` is one of the two controllers already migrated to a repository and an
injected clock. The other six open a `SqlConnection` and run inline SQL in the request path.

## Beat 2: what the agent got right, and what it did not

Six of the eight controllers do data access with inline SQL, so an agent reading the codebase for
house style has a majority to copy. Neither run copied it. Both read the committed
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) block, which says in the spec's own words that the twelve inline-SQL
sites are grandfathered debt and that new code must not add to them, and both wrote the lookup as
a call through the already-injected `IBookingRepository`:

```csharp
[HttpGet("{reference}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetByReference(string reference)
{
    Booking? booking = await bookings.Get(reference);
    if (booking is null) return NotFound();

    return Ok(booking);
}
```

That is the rendered block doing its job: it steered the first attempt away from the pattern
Meridian is retiring, with no check involved. What the block did not say is what to call the
method. `GetByReference` returns a `Task`, `naming/async-suffix` is a second ratchet with thirteen
sites already on the record, and `IBookingRepository.Get`, one line above in the same file, is one
of the thirteen. So the agent copied a name that is grandfathered rather than allowed, and this
compiles, runs, and is new debt.

## Beat 3: the turn ends, and the hook refuses the stop

The agent finished and tried to hand the work back. The `Stop` hook ran `check` over the working
tree, the ratchet went red on the one new site, and the hook exited 2 with this report on stderr:

```text
pass layering/domain-independent — The Domain layer must not reference the Web layer.
pass naming/controllers — Types derived from `ControllerBase` must be named `*Controller`.
pass data-access/no-inline-sql — Types in `Meridian.Web.Controllers.*` must not reference `SqlConnection` or `SqlCommand`.
  grandfathered: 12 (baselined; run 'sliderule status' for burndown)
pass time/inject-clock — Types in the Web layer, except types named `SystemClock`, must not use `DateTime.Now` or `DateTime.UtcNow`.
  grandfathered: 7 (baselined; run 'sliderule status' for burndown)
FAIL naming/async-suffix — Methods of authored types in the Domain or Web layers returning `Task`, `Task<TResult>`, `ValueTask` or `ValueTask<TResult>` must be named `*Async`.
  because: Task- and ValueTask-returning methods carry the Async suffix so callers see at the call site that a method must be awaited.

  fix: Rename the method to end in Async and update its callers; see the interface and its implementation together.
  src/Meridian.Web/Controllers/BookingsController.cs:60 — Meridian.Web.Controllers.BookingsController.GetByReference()

pass di/no-buildserviceprovider — Types must not use `ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.BuildServiceProvider()`.
pass clearance/engine/containment — Types in `Meridian.Clearance.*`, except `IClearanceGateway` or `ClearanceGateway`, must be referenced only by types in `Meridian.Clearance.*`, `IClearanceGateway` or `ClearanceGateway`.
  grandfathered: 1 (baselined; run 'sliderule status' for burndown)
pass clearance/engine/tripwire

Checked 8 rules: 7 passed, 1 failed, 0 skipped (1 violation, 0 warnings).
```

Claude Code turns exit 2 into a refused stop and hands that stderr back as the reason, which is how
it arrives in the transcript:

```text
Stop hook feedback:
[sh "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/examples/Meridian/hooks/arch-hook.sh"]: pass layering/domain-independent — …
```

The report carries the five things an agent needs to act: the rule ID (`naming/async-suffix`), the
reason, the page that reason rests on, the fix, and the exact `file:line`. The sites already
on the record stay quiet, reported as a passing rule with `grandfathered: 13`; only the new name is
red. Two lines above it, the inline-SQL sites are quiet for the same reason, and that is the debt
the block had already talked the agent out of adding to.

## Beat 4: the agent self-corrects

The agent read the report and renamed the method, in one edit and with no help from anyone:

> The arch hook caught the async naming violation. I need to rename the method to follow the
> async suffix convention.

```csharp
[HttpGet("{reference}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetByReferenceAsync(string reference)
```

Then it stopped again. The hook ran the check a second time, found the tree clean, wrote nothing,
and exited 0, so the turn ended. Run the same check by hand and it prints the board with
`naming/async-suffix` back among the passes; only its summary line is shown here:

```text
Checked 8 rules: 8 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (0 violations, 0 warnings).
```

Nothing shipped in the old shape, and the correction was the tool's own fix line rather than a
reviewer catching it later. Between the two stops the hook cost one check, not one per edit.

## Beat 5: a different task, and the warning that does not block

> Ops report that container numbers from one partner are rejected as invalid. ISO 6346 allows `J`
> and `Z` in the category position as well as `U`; `ContainerNumberValidator` accepts only `U`.

That is a real bug, the fix is one line, and it lives inside `Meridian.Clearance`, the scope the
spec quarantines. The agent widened the check:

```csharp
// ISO 6346 category identifiers: U freight, J detachable equipment, Z trailers and chassis.
if (containerNumber[3] is not ('U' or 'J' or 'Z')) return false;
```

Nothing here breaks a law. Containment governs who may *reference* the scope from outside, and this
edit is inside it, so the check is clean and the hook exits 0. What the check does say is that
the edit landed in dragon territory, and a warning has only exit 0 to travel on. So the hook writes
the report as the one exit-0 object Claude Code reads, naming the event that fired. The object's
`additionalContext` is cut short here and printed in full below it:

```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "Stop",
    "additionalContext": "warn clearance/engine/tripwire\r\n  warning: Changed file 'src/Meridian.Clearance/ContainerNumberValidator.cs' …"
  }
}
```

Inside it is the report without the seven rules that passed, which the agent already has in its
instructions. What remains is the rule that warned and the summary line:

```text
warn clearance/engine/tripwire
  warning: Changed file 'src/Meridian.Clearance/ContainerNumberValidator.cs' is inside quarantined scope 'clearance/engine' — does the task actually require editing dragon territory? Dragons: sliderule explain clearance/engine/tripwire.
  dragons: ISO 6346 check digit: the letter-value table skips every multiple of 11 (A=10, B=12 … U=32); the gaps are structural — linearizing the table breaks every real container number. Call in only through IClearanceGateway.

Checked 8 rules: 8 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (0 violations, 1 warning).
```

Claude Code delivers that as a `Stop hook additional context` message and lets the turn continue
once, which is the whole of the tripwire: the dragons arrive under the warning that fired, so the
agent reads them where it is standing rather than paying a round trip to `explain`. It answered
them point by point:

> **The dragons warn about the letter-value table specifically** — `A=10, B=12 … U=32`, every
> multiple of 11 skipped, gaps structural. I didn't touch `ContainerCheckDigit`. The table is
> what makes `J` and `Z` score correctly without any change, which is why the fix is one line in
> the validator and nothing in the check digit.

The category fix ships. What does not happen is the next edit: an agent one file away from a
letter-value table with three gaps in it, told that the gaps are structural before it decides they
are a typo. That is the difference between the two postures on one codebase: Beat 3's ratchet
refuses a stop that would have left new code in a retired shape, and the tripwire lets a legitimate
edit through while making sure nobody makes it uninformed.

## Reproduce it

From a checkout, build the CLI and the example once, then walk the loop by hand. This repository is
a source checkout, so each `sliderule …` below runs as
`dotnet run --no-build --project src/SlideRule.Cli -- …` from the repository root; install
the [global tool](../README.md#run-it-yourself) to use the real `sliderule` command.

```bash
dotnet build src/SlideRule.Cli
dotnet build examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx
sliderule check examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx      # exit 0: the committed baseline is clean
```

Add the Beat 2 method to `BookingsController` above its `sample` endpoint, and check again. The
check reads source, so no rebuild is needed for this one. The second line drives the hook the way
Claude Code does, with a `Stop` payload on stdin:

```bash
sliderule check examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx --diff-base HEAD   # exit 1: the Beat 3 board
echo '{"hook_event_name":"Stop","session_id":"storyboard"}' | sliderule hook examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx   # exit 2: the board, on stderr
```

The hook checks with `--diff-base HEAD` too. That only evaluates the quarantined-scope tripwire (the
extra `pass clearance/engine/tripwire` line) and does not change the failing rule. The hook prints
nothing and exits 0 once you switch to the Beat 4 name. It keeps what it found for each
`session_id` under the temp directory, so a second run over a clean tree nobody has touched skips
the check. Revert `BookingsController` when you are done so the example tree stays clean.

Beat 5 is the same loop with the tripwire armed. Widen the category check in
`ContainerNumberValidator` as the beat does, rebuild, and check:

```bash
dotnet build examples/Meridian/src/Meridian.Clearance/Meridian.Clearance.csproj
sliderule check examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx --diff-base HEAD   # exit 0: the Beat 5 board
echo '{"hook_event_name":"Stop","session_id":"storyboard"}' | sliderule hook examples/Meridian/Meridian.slnx   # the warning, as hook context
```

The hook's output is the JSON object Claude Code reads at the stop: one `hookSpecificOutput`,
naming the event that fired. The rule that warned and the summary line are escaped into its
`additionalContext`. Run both against the reverted tree and the check prints a clean board while
the hook prints nothing at all: a clean check with no warnings says nothing to the agent.
