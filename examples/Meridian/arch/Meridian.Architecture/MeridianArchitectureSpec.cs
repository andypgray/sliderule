///     Meridian's architecture spec — the freight-forwarding monolith mid-migration, carrying
///     three postures on one codebase: Enforce for the law it already keeps, Migrate for the three
///     ratchets being worked off (inline SQL in controllers; ambient-clock reads; Task-returning
///     methods without the Async suffix), and Quarantine for the ISO 6346 clearance engine, contained
///     behind its gateway. Five rules are Meridian's own; two come from the shared
///     <c>DotNetGuidance</c> pack, taken a la carte at the postures this codebase warrants.

// This example's README quotes rules from the class below as they are written here, continuation
// columns included, and the compiled spec is the same whichever way they are laid out. The marker
// holds the formatter off everything after it, so the shape a reader meets here is the shape they
// meet there, and the file still goes through cleanup with the rest of the tree, with no exception
// to remember. It is unbalanced on purpose: the quoted blocks sit throughout Define.

        // the start. The subject for the naming rule is the two layers rather than a project, so the rule
