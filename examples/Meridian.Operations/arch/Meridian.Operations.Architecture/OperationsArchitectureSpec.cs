/// <summary>
///     The operations subsystem's architecture spec — Meridian's modular monolith, where the
///     module boundaries are drawn by namespace inside one project, not by separate
///     assemblies. Each module keeps its internals to itself and is reached through a Contracts
///     surface; the module dependency graph is explicit and acyclic; and the demurrage engine is
///     quarantined behind its calculator facade.

// This example's README quotes rules from the class below in the layout they have here, continuation
// columns included, and the compiled spec is the same whichever way they are laid out. The marker
// holds the formatter off everything after it, so the shape a reader meets here is the shape they
// meet there, and the file still goes through cleanup with the rest of the tree, with no exception
// to remember. It is unbalanced on purpose: the quoted blocks sit throughout Define.
// The README writes the Selection locals out in place, so its quote is not a substring of this file
// and no test holds it: a change to a quoted rule is copied there by hand.
// @formatter:off
