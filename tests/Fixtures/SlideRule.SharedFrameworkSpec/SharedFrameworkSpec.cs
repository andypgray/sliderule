///     A spec that cannot load, for one specific reason: its <c>typeof()</c> anchor names a type from a

/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The anchor is confined to the <c>Define()</c> body on purpose. A spec class that itself derived
///         from an ASP.NET type would fail earlier, in <c>SpecDiscovery.FindSpecs</c>, and surface as the
///         <c>ReflectionTypeLoadException</c> arm — a different message, and the wrong one to guard here.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The rule is otherwise ordinary and would pass; nothing about it is reached, because
///         <c>Define()</c> throws on the first anchor.
