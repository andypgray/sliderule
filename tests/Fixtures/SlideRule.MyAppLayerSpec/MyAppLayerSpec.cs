///     <para>
///         Rendered against the MyApp solution it produces the root block, a merged block in
///         <c>MyApp.Web/</c> whose Web card precedes the Reporting card (declaration order), and — in
///         <c>MyApp.Legacy.Billing/</c> — a merged block whose Billing layer card precedes the
///         quarantined-scope card (layer key before quarantine key). The quarantined layer's desugared
///         containment is layer-anchored yet Quarantine-posture, so it renders only as the quarantine card
///         and is never double-emitted as a layer bullet. Web carries a purpose and Billing does not, so the
///         Web card's lede carries the sentence and the Billing card's does not.

///     <para>
///         Web is anchored on its project rather than on <c>MyApp.Web.*</c> deliberately: the two name the
///         same types here, so every card, sentence and verdict below is a byte-for-byte statement that a
///         layer checks and renders as whatever defines it. Reporting is the refinement — the shape a cone
///         nested inside another needs — and it narrows Web to the four <c>Report*</c> types, none of which
///         touches billing, so the Reporting rule holds where Web's does not.
