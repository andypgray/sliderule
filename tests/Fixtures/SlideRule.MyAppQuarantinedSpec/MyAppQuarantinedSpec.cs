/// <summary>
///     A scopes-only spec for the MyApp fixture: two Quarantine scopes and a Caution, and deliberately no

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The billing quarantine has a sanctioned facade surface and no explicit <c>.Baseline</c>, so its
///         containment resolves to the conventional default
///         <c>arch/baselines/legacy/billing/containment.json</c> — the committed grandfather baseline that
///         records InvoiceController's pre-existing interior references. Against it, <c>check</c> is exit 0
///         (containment passes; the tripwire skips without a <c>--diff-base</c>) — the grandfathered-quarantine
///         e2e.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A second scope carries the field's sanctioned-consumer shape (GRAMMAR §7): its boundary is a type
///         <em>outside</em> the scope, named rather than anchored by <c>typeof</c>, and it is the only thing
///         that reaches in — so it passes uncaptured, with no baseline of its own.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A third carries the Caution posture, which has no red state at all and therefore never moves the
///         exit code — which is why the diff-aware tripwire e2e can prove "warns and exits 0" here, on the
///         one spec whose whole-run verdict is green to begin with.
