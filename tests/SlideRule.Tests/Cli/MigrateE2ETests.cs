///     The migrate posture's two acceptances, against one private copy of the fixture whose
///     <c>DataTable</c> pairs are fully grandfathered (the clean spec's <c>arch/clean-baseline.json</c>):
///     a baseline entry keys on stable symbol IDs, so it survives a file move; and it records how many
///     sites it grandfathers, so a second helping of the old pattern inside an already-grandfathered pair
///     is new code and red. One class, so the fixture copy and its restore are paid once.

/// <remarks>
///     A copy rather than the committed fixture, and that is the point rather than mere hygiene: the four
///     <c>check</c> goldens and the MCP truncation-budget pins are all measured against the fixture as
///     committed, so growing it in place would move every one of them for a fact none of them is about.
