/// <summary>
///     The silent edge, made a permanent fact: a rule that reds on the restored tree does not pass on the
///     same tree with the restore broken, and the cure it prints while inert names the partial model rather
///     than the shape of its own selection.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The defect needs a bed of its own. With the restore broken, the external edge a violation rests
///         on is never extracted, so the rule reports itself inert and the run passes. Nothing shorter than a
///         real restore can hold that: every cheaper surface pin downstream of the gate takes the project list
///         as given, and the whole question here is whether the list is produced at all.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The bed is hermetic and commits no binary. The package is manufactured into a folder feed at test
///         time, <c>&lt;clear/&gt;</c> in the bed's <c>NuGet.config</c> drops every other source, and
///         <c>NUGET_PACKAGES</c> points at a directory under this copy, so an operator's warm global package
///         folder cannot satisfy a restore whose feed is unreachable.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Three arms: restored, broken, and never restored at all, the state a fresh clone and a cold CI
///         runner are both in. They share one bed because the comparison is the point: one tree, one spec, and
///         the only difference between the arms is what a restore did or did not leave behind.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Nothing is built. The bed needs a restore, not a compile: <c>MSBuildWorkspace</c>'s
///         design-time build resolves package assets out of <c>project.assets.json</c>, which is exactly the
///         file the arms differ in. The spec is compiled in-process by
///         <see cref="SpecAssemblyCompiler" /> and passed as an explicit DLL, so no project in the bed is ever
///         built either.
