/// <summary>
///     What a baseline file does when two branches burn it down at once, put through a real three-way text
///     merge (<c>git merge-file</c>, which needs no repository): two branches paying off different entries
///     of one rule merge clean and the merged file verifies with nothing to re-run; the same two payoffs in
///     the legacy whole-file-digest format merge their <em>entries</em> clean and conflict on the one line
///     that covers all of them, after which neither resolution verifies; and where line adjacency does
///     force a conflict, keeping whole entry lines from either side yields a file the reader accepts.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     These rows hold the claim the per-entry seal exists to make, so they assert through
///     <see cref="BaselineStore.TryReadDocument" /> rather than by reading the merged text: what matters is
///     not that the bytes look plausible but that the tool accepts them without asking anyone to re-run a
///     valve. The claim is narrow on purpose — a conflict over one rule is <em>resolvable by hand</em>,
///     not impossible — which is why the third row stands beside the first. Resolutions here are performed
///     on git's own output by choosing whole lines, never by recomputing anything: that is the property
///     under test, and a helper that composed a fresh file would assert nothing about it.
