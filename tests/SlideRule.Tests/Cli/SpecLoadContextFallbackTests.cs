///         The arm is not on the missing-dependency route.
///         <see cref="AssemblyDependencyResolver" /> re-checks the disk before returning a path, so a
///         dependency that has gone resolves to null, <see cref="AssemblyLoadContext.Load" /> returns null,
///         and the spec's own directory stops being consulted at all — whatever happens next belongs to the
///         Default context. The arm is reached only when the spec DLL named on the command line is itself
///         gone by the time it is loaded, and there the failure names the path, because a path is all the
///         loader was given. Both facts are the ordinary shape of a rebuild landing underneath a running
///         host, which the long-lived MCP server is.

///         here. It cannot be pinned against a net10 one: once the resolver returns null the outcome is the
