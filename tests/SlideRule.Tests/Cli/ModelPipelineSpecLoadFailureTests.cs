/// <summary>
///     The join between <see cref="ModelPipeline.LoadModel" />'s spec-load catch arms and the failures
///     they exist for; the contract-mismatch arms are driven by <see cref="SpecContractSkewE2ETests" />.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Each arm's <em>message</em> is pinned elsewhere against a fabricated
///     exception (<see cref="ModelPipelineLoaderFailureTests" />,
///     <c>SpecDependencyLoadFailureTests</c>), and the runtime behaviour of the unloadable type is pinned
///     in <c>LegacySpecLoadingTests</c> — but proving both halves does not prove they meet. These tests
///     drive real spec DLLs through the entry point a user reaches, and assert the inner exception as
///     well as the text, because the inner exception is what identifies <em>which</em> arm caught.
///     <para>
///         Two failures come from one fixture. <c>SlideRule.LegacyBrokenSpec</c> declares a type
///         whose base lives in the product assembly and a <c>Define()</c> that anchors a type which cannot
///         load on .NET at all; withholding the product DLL therefore fails it during discovery, and
///         staging it intact fails it during <c>Define()</c>. See <see cref="SpecOutputStager" /> for why
///         withholding a real build beats committing a corrupt one.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The missing-dependency arm reaches two different remedies, and both are driven here from real
///         builds rather than from fabricated exceptions, because which remedy the reader is handed is the
///         part that was wrong in the field. <c>SlideRule.SharedFrameworkSpec</c> is the one no
///         build setting can fix — it needs no staging trick at all, because a shared framework is absent
///         from a spec's output however the spec project is written.
