///     long-lived MCP server meant a path load pinned the spec DLL and its dependencies for the whole
///     host lifetime. Every <c>dotnet build</c> of the spec project then failed (MSB3021/MSB3027) until
///     the server was killed, and killing a stdio server is terminal: the client never reconnects one,
///     so the per-edit <c>arch_check</c> hook stayed silently disarmed for the rest of the session.
///     <c>SpecLoadContext</c> loads from bytes to keep that from happening; this pins it.
