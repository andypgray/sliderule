///         passed, and which warning gated was measured, not inferred. .NET 10 emits it for a large and

///         warning is baked into <c>project.assets.json</c> at restore time and replayed into every later
///         design-time build, so nothing short of a real restore proves the diagnostic reaches a workspace
///         at all — and a fix that stopped surfacing it would pass the injected tests.

///         of this repository's test tree.
