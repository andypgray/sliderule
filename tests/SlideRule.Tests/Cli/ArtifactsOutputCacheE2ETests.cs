///     The persisted extraction cache against a real <c>UseArtifactsOutput</c> tree, with the default layout
///     beside it as the control — the output layout is the only variable. Both arms restore a private copy of
///     the fixture with the real SDK, so what is under test is not only the path derivation but the claim it
///     rests on: that the assets file lands where <see cref="IntermediateOutputTree" /> looks for it.

///         <b>Why a live restore rather than a fabricated tree.</b>
///         <c>Caching/ExtractionCacheStoreTests</c> already pins the store's behaviour over a hand-built
///         artifacts-shaped tree, and <c>Roslyn/IntermediateOutputTreeTests</c> pins the derivation as
///         arithmetic. Neither can know where the SDK actually writes <c>project.assets.json</c>, and that is
///         exactly what a field run found wrong: the probe watched
///         <c>&lt;projectDirectory&gt;/obj/project.assets.json</c>, a path this layout never creates, so a
///         re-restore that changed the model was served from cache as though nothing had moved.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why the mutation is a byte append.</b> The third run has to load a workspace, so the assets
///         file must stay readable by the SDK; trailing whitespace changes the bytes the store stamps without
///         changing what NuGet parses.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Both arms take a dedicated copy: the leased copy resets by pruning anything the fixture source
