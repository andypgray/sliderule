///         <c>MyApp.sln</c> is one no walk-up could resolve to; and pointing back at
///         <c>../TestSolutions/MyApp/MyApp.sln</c> is also what proves the parser's two resolution bases
///         are real: the solution resolves against the filter's directory and every project
///         entry against the solution's. They therefore run <em>in place</em> from the build output rather
///         than through a leased copy, which would strand the relative path. The one exception is the
///         write-anchor row, whose filter is written per-run and names its solution absolutely, because
///         showing where a rendered file lands means letting one be written.

///         it selects plus the transitive closure, and only a selection at the bottom of the chain leaves
///         anything out. <c>DomainAndWeb.slnf</c> selects two of three and narrows nothing — Billing arrives
