///     <c>--spec</c> resolves before the workspace is touched and exercises none of the walk.

///         <b>The root props file is not optional.</b> The fixture spec reaches the contract library through
///         a <c>HintPath</c> spelled as the property below, because every consumer copies the tree to a temp
///         directory and a relative <c>ProjectReference</c> into <c>src/</c> cannot survive that copy.
///         Nothing restores or builds the fixture in place, so the property has to arrive in a
///         <c>Directory.Build.props</c> written beside the copied solution — which also stops MSBuild's
///         upward walk at the copy root, keeping whatever happens to live above the temp directory out of
///         the build.

///         silently wrong in another.
