///         This is how the spec-load failure arms get driven end to end without a fixture project that
///         exists only to be corrupt. A spec whose dependency is not beside it is an ordinary deployment
///         mistake — a class-library build that never staged a package assembly, a copy that missed a
///         file — and the honest way to reproduce it is to stage a real build and leave the dependency
///         out, rather than to break it at build time and then have to keep it broken.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Withholding is by file name, matched at any depth, so the caller names the DLL rather than a
///         path. The staged copy is a directory of its own: <c>SpecLoadContext</c> resolves through an
///         <c>AssemblyDependencyResolver</c> rooted at the spec DLL, which for a net48 build (no
///         <c>.deps.json</c>) falls back to the spec's own directory — so what is absent from the staged
///         directory is genuinely absent from resolution.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Staging intact and then deleting is a different case, not a longer way to withhold.</b> A net10
///         spec carries a <c>.deps.json</c>, and the resolver reads it once when the load context is
///         constructed while re-checking the disk on every resolve. Withholding therefore means "never
///         staged", which the resolver sees from the first call; deleting from the staged copy afterwards
///         means "was there, and a rebuild took it away underneath a running host", which it sees only on the
///         next one. <c>SpecLoadContextFallbackTests</c> needs the second and stages intact to get it.
