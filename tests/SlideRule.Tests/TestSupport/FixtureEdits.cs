/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>The freshness contract every method here is written against.</b> Both the workspace sweep and
///         the persisted extraction cache decide what to re-read by comparing a file's mtime against the one
///         recorded when it was last seen, and a file stamped close to now is treated as racy — re-read
///         rather than trusted. So the two directions are stamped deliberately, and neither number is
///         arbitrary.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Forward, +2s.</b> An edit stamps the future, which guarantees the sweep sees a delta against
///         the load-time fingerprint whatever the filesystem's timestamp granularity — an edit stamped
///         "now" can land inside the same tick as the load and read as unchanged.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Backward, -1d.</b> Backdating puts every input comfortably outside the racy window, so the
///         next capture stamps it promoted — the precondition for the stat fast path. It is best-effort
///         throughout: a file that cannot be re-stamped stays racy and simply re-reads, which costs a read
///         and no correctness.
