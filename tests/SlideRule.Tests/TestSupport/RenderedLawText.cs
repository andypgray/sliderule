///     render verb splices into a file. Spelled once because two copies of a string would let one drift:
///     the CLI-versus-MCP parity rows and the end-to-end render goldens only mean the same thing while
///     the text they compare is literally the same text.

///     The cards here carry no provenance line — that is a render file-splice concern rather than part of
