///     build a fixture rather than only read it. The shared <see cref="WorkspaceFixture" /> output tree is
///     read-only and shared across the assembly, so a test that edits fixture files or baselines must run
///     against its own copy.

/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>One copy per test class, reset between tests — not one per test.</b> The copy is leased, keyed
///         on the calling source file (one type per file, so that is the test class). The first test in a
///         class pays the copy and the <c>dotnet restore</c>; each later test in that class gets the same
///         directory with its tree reset to pristine. Classes run in parallel, but a class's own tests run one
///         at a time, so a lease is contended only by a test that holds two copies at once; that test, like
///         any caller whose lease is held, gets a private copy instead.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why the path must be stable, not merely private.</b> <c>CacheLocations</c> keys the extraction
///         cache on a hash of the canonical solution path, so a new path is a guaranteed cold miss, and a cold
///         <c>check</c> costs far more than the restore (measured on the MyApp fixture). Holding the path
///         steady across a class turns every test after the first into the warm case.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>What the reset guarantees.</b> Every source file is returned to its fixture content and
///         anything a previous test created (baselines, probe sources) is deleted, so a test sees the same
///         tree whether it ran first or last. <c>bin</c>/<c>obj</c> are left alone — that is what keeps the
///         restore valid — and a re-restore happens only if a project or solution file actually changed.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>The reset and the warm pool.</b> A <see cref="WarmWorkspacePool" /> session for this tree
///         outlives the test that loaded it, which is the point, but it must never make a reset fail or go
///         unseen. A restored file carries the pristine source's write time, which the session's reconcile
///         sweep reads as a change, so the reset is always seen. A reset blocked by a held file drops the
///         pooled session and tries once more before giving the lease up.
