///     The test project's one recursive directory copy. A fixture's private copy, a spec's staged output

/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <b>A directory link is copied, never descended.</b> The recursion is by hand rather than
///         <see cref="SearchOption.AllDirectories" />, whose enumeration walks into link targets, and these
///         trees contain links — the symlinked-root tripwire test leaves one beside its repo.
///         <see cref="ReadOnlyTolerant" />'s delete already picked that side and says why; a copy that
///         descended where the delete will not would build trees nothing can take down again.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Files overwrite.</b> A destination that already holds a file of the same name is written over
///         rather than left alone, so no caller has to clear the destination first.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Destination directories are created per copied file</b>, so a source directory whose every
///         file <c>include</c> withholds leaves no empty directory behind. Nothing needs them — git does not
///         track empty directories, and assembly resolution does not enumerate them — but the result is not
///         a directory-for-directory mirror and should not be read as one.
