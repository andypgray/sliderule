/// <summary>
///     The integrity pin under <see cref="WarmWorkspacePool" />: a warm session that outlives the test which
///     loaded it must never serve the previous test's tree. Both facts drive the exact sequence the harness
///     performs between tests in a class — lease, mutate, read; release; lease again (which resets the tree
///     to pristine), read again — and assert the second read sees the fixture, not the mutation.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The two facts split on how <c>WorkspaceSession</c> has to notice the reset. An in-place content
///     restore is folded into the snapshot chain; a deleted file forces a full reload. The first is the one
///     with a
///     <see cref="SlideRule.Roslyn.Caching.FileFreshness.RacyWindow">racy window</see>, so it gets
///     the load-count assertion too.
