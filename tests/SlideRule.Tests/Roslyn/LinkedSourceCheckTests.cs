/// <summary>
///     The MSBuild tier of edge attribution where one source file compiles into several projects
///     (GRAMMAR §4.1), over the real <c>LinkedApp</c> fixture solution: <c>LinkedApp.Tool</c> compiles
///     <c>LinkedApp.Core</c>'s <c>Shared/Widget.cs</c> as its own source through a
///     <c>&lt;Compile Include&gt;</c> link and declares no <c>ProjectReference</c> to Core at all, while
///     <c>LinkedApp.Client</c> reaches Core through a real one. The fast-path bed in
///     <c>Checking.MultiplyDeclaredAttributionTests</c> hands one source text to each declaring project
///     itself, so it supplies the very shape it then reasons over; this pins the half only a real workspace
///     can, that a link written in a project file is what puts the second declarer on the node — the roster
///     both verdicts below turn on, and the one a hand-built input cannot establish.

///         <b>The checker's half of the fixture.</b> <c>Cli.LinkedSourceGraphE2ETests</c> drives the
///         <c>graph</c> verb over these same three projects through the CLI — the rendered survey, the
///         absent Tool→Core edge, and the coverage statement naming every declarer. This class carries the
///         checker over the extracted model: which rule, anchored on which project, reaches which verdict,
///         which is the question that coverage statement exists to answer for a spec author.
///     </para>

///         <b>Why the red row stands beside the green one.</b> Green on its own would prove nothing — an
///         empty subject, an empty target, or a model that never extracted is green too. The two rows run
///         the same verb against the same target operand and part only on the project the subject names, so
///         the red is reachable only if both selections are live over a model that really loaded.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The bed is read in place through <see cref="WarmWorkspacePool" /> rather than leased through
