///     The measurement that licenses gating on <see cref="SdkStyleProject.IsSdkStyle" />: whether an SDK-style
///     project can be told from a non-SDK-style one reliably enough that a missing <c>project.assets.json</c>
///     may be blamed on the first and never on the second.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         A measurement rather than a description, because the predicate on its own only says what the XML
///         contains while the claim it is used for is larger: that SDK-style projects write an assets file
///         when they restore, and legacy ones never do.
///         So the corpus below pairs each verdict with the file it predicts: every project under the three
///         roots it scans, classified, and beside each one whether an assets file is actually on disk at a
///         location <see cref="IntermediateOutputTree.AssetsPathsOf" /> stamps. The only rows where the two
///         columns come apart are the beds deliberately left unrestored — the state the gate exists to
///         catch — and the output-layout and render-containment beds, which are restored only inside the
///         temp copies that drive them.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Real files rather than only written shapes: the written ones fix the boundaries — a comment
///         mentioning an SDK, malformed XML, a legacy project that happens to declare a property called
///         <c>Sdk</c> — but they are written by the same reading of MSBuild that wrote the predicate, so only
///         the real corpus could refute it. <c>FieldMini.Core.csproj</c> and <c>BrokenApp.Web.csproj</c> are
///         its awkward ones on purpose, each carrying its root element under dozens of lines of XML comment.

///         <c>src/</c> and <c>arch/</c> — and not every project file this repository tracks. Out are the
///         spec-fixture projects under <c>tests/Fixtures/</c> and the test project itself, which are solution
///         members and so would every one read <c>SDK-style, assets file present</c>; and everything under
///         <c>examples/</c>, which no run of this suite restores, so their assets column would report
