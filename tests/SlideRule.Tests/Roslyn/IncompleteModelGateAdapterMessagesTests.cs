/// <summary>
///     The xUnit adapter's two incomplete-model messages, pinned directly against a synthetic
///     <see cref="WorkspaceDiagnostics" /> rather than through a fixture solution.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         <c>AdapterTests</c> owns the adapter's behaviour — which test fails, which cases skip — over the
///         real <c>BrokenApp</c> bed that loads partially. There is no such bed for a
///         failed restore, and building one would cost a live SDK and a private package feed to prove
///         something these two methods already decide on their own: both are pure functions of the
///         diagnostics, and everything downstream of them is
///         <see cref="SlideRule.Tests.Cli.RestoreFailureSilentEdgeE2ETests" />' subject.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Both messages carry their evidence inline, unlike the four CLI verbs that point at warnings printed
///         above them: in a test report there is nothing above to point at.
