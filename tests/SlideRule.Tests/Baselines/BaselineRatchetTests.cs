///     The four-way ratchet call (GRAMMAR §4.3) at its owner: how many sites a run observed under a
///     <see cref="BaselineEntry" />, against how many that entry grandfathers. One row per arm —
///     uncounted, shrunk, held, grown, and the two routes to nothing-to-measure. The checker's verdict and
///     <c>sliderule baseline accept-reductions</c> both read this, so the arms are pinned here once
///     rather than once per caller, which is the whole point of there being an owner.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         Both routes to "nothing to measure" are rows because the two callers used to disagree about an
///         edge seen with no sited evidence, and the disagreement was invisible precisely because neither
///         side's tests could see the other's reading.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The expected arm is spelled in each row's name rather than passed to it: the states are internal
///         to Core, and a public test signature cannot name one.
