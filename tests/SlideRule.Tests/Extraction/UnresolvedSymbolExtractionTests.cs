/// <summary>
///     Extraction is total over symbols the compiler never resolved. A workspace that loads only partially
///     — a project whose references are missing, a package that was never restored — hands Roslyn error
///     symbols to the external-mint path through base types, interfaces, and attribute classes, and every
///     fact minted from one has to have an answer: a fact without one kills a survey over an unbuilt tree
///     with an invariant violation naming a symbol nobody wrote.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The negative control lives in <see cref="Roslyn.AccessibilityMapperTests" />: it pins that these
///     symbols really do report <c>TypeKind.Error</c> and <c>Accessibility.NotApplicable</c>, so a Roslyn
///     change that started resolving them would surface there rather than making these tests pass vacuously.
///     Compiled against the core library only, so <c>Ghost.*</c> is unresolvable by construction — no
///     MSBuild, no workspace, no timing.
