/// <summary>
///     The last leg of the legacy bridge: a binlog produced by .NET Framework <c>MSBuild.exe</c> — the
///     build a classic build server actually runs — replayed by the .NET 10 CLI. The oracle is byte
///     parity: <c>check --binlog</c> over that binlog and a plain <c>check</c> that opens the workspace
///     itself must produce the same output, so nothing about the replay path is a lesser reading of the
///     codebase. The replay leg additionally opens no workspace at all, which is the claim in its
///     strongest form: the machine that builds needs no .NET 10, only the machine that analyses.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Gated twice over: Windows, and a Visual Studio or Build Tools install carrying
///     <c>MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe</c>. Rather than probing for one, the test reads the install
///     root <c>MsBuildBootstrap</c> already chose and published — no second selection policy, and the
///     MSBuild it drives is the one the product picked. Going through <c>VsWhereLocator</c> directly would
///     reach inside the <c>roslyn/msbuild-bootstrap</c> quarantine, which this repository's own spec
///     forbids outside <c>MsBuildBootstrap</c>.
