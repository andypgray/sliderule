///     The mutability verb <c>MustBeReadonly</c> over the fast path (GRAMMAR §5.7, §4.6): a field is red

///     <see cref="FieldSelection" />, so the other projections cannot spell it.

/// <remarks>
///     A const field satisfies the verb, const being readonly's superset (GRAMMAR §5.7), and that decision
///     is pinned here rather than left to each spec. It lives in the checker because
///     <c>.Fields.ThatAreStatic()</c> sweeps every constant a type declares, and a rule author who had to
///     remember the exception would eventually not. Violations are
///     <see cref="ViolationKind.MemberShape" />, identity the member's DocId riding
