/// <summary>
///     The correspondence verb <c>MustHaveExactlyOneCounterpart</c> over the fast path (GRAMMAR §5.3, §4.1,
///     §4.3): per subject the <c>named:</c> template derives a name — every <c>{Name}</c> replaced by the
///     subject's simple name — and exactly one type in the <c>among:</c> selection must carry it. Zero
///     counterparts and several are both red, so the rule states a one-to-one law rather than a
///     one-way existence check.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The verb reads names off the model the selections already resolve, so it adds no extracted fact.
///     Both arms mint <see cref="ViolationKind.Shape" /> keyed on the SUBJECT symbol ID
///     (<see cref="BaselineEntry.ForSubject" />) and differ only in evidence: the missing arm points at the
///     subject's own declaration, the ambiguous arm at the counterparts that collide. Counterparts are
///     evidence and never identity, which is what keeps a grandfathered subject grandfathered when the arm
///     flips. An <c>among:</c> selection matching nothing reds every subject without failing as an empty one,
///     since operand emptiness is not subject emptiness. Each dead part of it warns that the rule is not
///     measured as written, except on a narrowed run.
