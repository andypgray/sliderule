/// <summary>
///     The narrowed-universe skip: under a solution filter, a rule whose <em>every</em> violation is an
///     empty subject reached no verdict rather than a red one — its subject lived in the projects the
///     filter left out, so the run has nothing to say about it. All four empty-selection sites take it
///     (type subject, member subject, per-operand union, project subject), and nothing else does.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The two guards either side of the predicate are the point. With no narrowing an empty subject is
///     still red, because a spec naming a namespace the solution does not have is a defect (the fail-closed
///     default of GRAMMAR §4.1); and under a narrowing a rule with a real finding is still red,
///     because types did load and the rule was measured. The wording of the reason is not pinned here — it
///     is minted in <c>NarrowedUniverseNotice.RuleSkipReason</c> and pinned there and end to end in
///     <see cref="SlideRule.Tests.Cli.FilteredSolutionE2ETests" />; what these rows pin is which
///     rules carry it.
