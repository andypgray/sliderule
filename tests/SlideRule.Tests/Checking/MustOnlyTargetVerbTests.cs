/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Two decisions are pinned here rather than left to be discovered. <b>Strict</b>: there is no
///     exemption for anything, because a project's frameworks are a closed set and every moniker it
///     declares is one this rule judges. <b>Absent-fact pass</b>: a project nothing evaluated declares no
///     framework, so it has nothing to judge and passes — a rule that redded there would be reporting the
///     load's own gaps as architecture violations.
