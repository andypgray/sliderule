/// <summary>
///     The two fitters and the budget behind them — the machinery that decides which rung of a runner's
///     coarsening ladder a caller actually gets, held here in isolation from any runner so the rungs can be
///     plain strings of known length. The two ladder rows are the exception and the other half of the same
///     question: which rungs a runner offers at all, and that the walk ends at the floor.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         Laziness is a correctness property here, not a performance note: composing a rung costs a full
///         serialization of the document, so a fitter that materializes the ladder pays for coarser answers
///         nobody reads. The rows below count what was pulled rather than trusting the shape of the code.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         So is the per-call budget read. A <see cref="ResponseBudget" /> that snapshotted its
///         <c>IEnvironment</c> at construction would pass every other row in this file and pin the first
///         call's cap for the life of the server — the failure <c>CliMcpParityTests.HarnessG</c> catches
