///     The gate over which bound string parameters refuse a JSON array a client serialized into them.
///     Every one of them does, with no recorded exception yet — and the guarded set is derived from the
///     live tool surface rather than listed, so the only thing kept by hand is the exemption ledger.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The refusal is wired per verb, by hand, because each surface recognizes the shape on its own
///         no-match path with its own advice (<see cref="SlideRule.Cli.Rendering.Refusals" />). A
///         fact about one path would say nothing about the next string parameter to land, and the failure it
///         would miss is quiet. The client's array binds as a legitimate-looking token, reaches the runner
///         intact, and comes back as a low-level error from whatever consumed it, or as a well-formed
///         negative answer to a question nobody asked. Phrased over every live string parameter, the gate
///         reds on the day a new one ships without the refusal.

///         the clause every refusal shares in the result. It does not pin any refusal's wording, or where
///         inside a verb the guard sits; those are <see cref="CheckCommandE2ETests" />,
