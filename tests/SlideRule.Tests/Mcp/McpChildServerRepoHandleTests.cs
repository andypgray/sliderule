/// <summary>
///     The property no architecture rule can express: a long-lived host must not retain a handle on this
///     repository's build outputs. Its two known failure shapes — a diff child inheriting the server's
///     JSON-RPC stdin, and path-loaded spec assemblies pinning the build output for the server's whole
///     lifetime — are checked here against a real child process over real stdio.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The tests run a live child because retention is a property of a process, not of a call: the
///         in-process harnesses load the same code into the test host, whose own footprint under the
///         repository is enormous and irrelevant. Only a separate process has a footprint that can be read
///         and required to be empty. <see cref="ProcessFileFootprint" /> reads it with two scans, mapped
///         views and handles.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A detector that silently sees nothing reports every process as clean.
///         <see cref="InRepoServer_MapsAndHoldsPathsUnderTheRepository" /> is therefore a committed negative
///         control: the same server launched the in-repo way (its images mapped out of the test output, its
///         working directory inside the repository) must be caught by <em>both</em> scans. It proves that
///         the zero its sibling asserts means something, and it reds if either scan or the device-path
///         translation behind it regresses.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Both tests count only what the server acquired for itself: they exclude the handles this process
///         already held when it started the child (see <see cref="LauncherHandlesUnderRepo" />). The
///         exclusion is exact-path and handle-only, and the negative control proves it does not gut the
///         scan, because the in-repo server's own working-directory handle survives it.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A profiler is the same story on the mapped-view side, which
///         inheritance cannot reach: under a coverage run the child inherits the environment naming the CLR
///         profiler and maps the collector's engine out of the test output, under this repository
///         (measured), and nothing the server does can decline it. So both tests discount whatever sits
///         under <see cref="ProcessFileFootprint.InjectedProfilerDirectory" /> — null, excusing nothing,
///         with no profiler attached. A profiler the harness forced in is not the server pinning the tree.
