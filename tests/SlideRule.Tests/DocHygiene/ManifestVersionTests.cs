///         with the release already in flight. A bump that reached the props file and one manifest
///         field is caught there by a job that has to be re-run against a new tag, and a tag is the one
///         thing in this flow that publishes. Catching the same disagreement in the suite costs
///         seconds and names the site.

///         <b>The fourth site is worse than unchecked.</b> The SARIF golden's driver version is held
///         only by <c>CheckCommandE2ETests</c>, which compares whole documents — so a missed bump
///         arrives as a JSON diff roughly nine minutes into a Release suite, at the end of a publish
///         run, reading like a rendering regression rather than like a number nobody changed.

///         <b>The props file is parsed as XML rather than matched.</b> Its own comment carries the
