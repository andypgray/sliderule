///     the rule id, an em dash, then the sentence the spec renders for that rule. This lifts every such
///     line out of a doc's fenced code blocks, indexes the rule sentences the committed <c>AGENTS.md</c>
///     files under an example root actually render, and decides whether each quoted sentence still
///     agrees with them. All of the logic lives here so the gate and the unit tests exercise the same
///     code path.

///             follows the OLD pattern: … New code must follow: &lt;sentence&gt; …
///         </c>
///         , so the quoted sentence
///         sits mid-bullet rather than at its start. The comparison is therefore an ordinal substring of
