/// <summary>
///     The hygiene gates over everything this repository publishes, rather than over a list of named
///     files. Two arms, split by where prose can hide: a C# source is read through the comment mask,
///     because only its comments carry prose a person wrote; every other text file is read whole,
///     because a settings file, a workflow or an ignore rule has no construct that separates prose
///     from data. Both arms run the internal working references and the shapes of a private
///     development environment; the source arm runs a third catalog over a text with the suppression
///     directives blanked out, for prose that narrates the development tooling to a stranger.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         Several facts guard the enumerator itself. An enumerator that degraded to an empty result
///         would turn every arm green over nothing, and a gate that passes because it read no files is
///         worse than no gate.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The third catalog runs over sources only. A settings file has to describe itself — which
///         entry it carries, and why that value rather than another — so sweeping the catalog across the
///         non-source set would red exactly the prose that makes those files readable. Narration growing
///         inside one of them is caught at review rather than here.
