///     captures carries a number: how many of its violations sit on the baseline beside them. This lifts
///     every such number out of a doc — from its fenced code blocks by shape, and from its prose by a
///     hand-registered template — and holds each to the <c>entries</c> array of the baseline JSON it came
///     from. All of the logic lives here so the gate and the unit tests exercise the same code path.

///         A report's grandfathered count is the number of baseline entries that matched a violation and

///         nothing; and a matched entry whose pair now carries more sites than it records is neither of
///         those — it is <em>grown</em>, and red. The identity is therefore
///         <c>entries = grandfathered + stale + grown</c>.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         This gate checks <c>entries = grandfathered + stale</c>, which is that identity with a grown term
///         of zero — and zero is what every capture a doc can carry reports, because a run with anything
///         grown is a failing run. Quote a grown run and the count no longer reconciles, which is a drift
///         report rather than a silence. Two of the five fenced shapes carry the stale count on the line, so
///         for them the identity is checked whole. The other three do not, and are pinned as
///         <c>entries = grandfathered</c>: the same identity with a stale term the quoted run reports as zero
///         elsewhere in its own capture. Every committed baseline here is at zero stale, and the day one is
