/// <summary>
///     The quote-sync gate over quoted rule sentences. The example walkthroughs, the landing page and the
///     self-check page quote captured <c>check</c> output, and every stanza opens with a rule-header line
///     carrying the sentence that rule renders — the same sentence <c>render</c> writes into the
///     <c>AGENTS.md</c> beside it. Nothing regenerates a hand-written doc, so this gate holds each quoted
///     sentence to the committed block it was copied from: a spec edit that changes a rendered sentence
///     and leaves a walkthrough behind fails the suite instead of publishing a page that contradicts the
///     <c>AGENTS.md</c> next to it. Two quotes are narrative — output from a draft spec, or from a check
///     over a test fixture that renders no block — and are pinned as such, so the day one starts matching
///     it is promoted rather than quietly counted as covered.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Sibling to <see cref="QuoteSyncTests" />, which covers the other quote shape: a whole fenced block
///     copied from a committed file, held line by line. A rule sentence cannot be held that way because a
///     <c>Migrate</c> rule renders it mid-bullet, wrapped in the old-pattern narration, so this gate
///     compares by ordinal containment against the bullet for its id. Like its sibling it reads only
///     committed bytes: no workspace load, no CLI invocation, so it stays cheap and parallel-safe.
