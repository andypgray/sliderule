/// <summary>
///     The gate that keeps every example spec holding the formatter off itself, from above its class
///     declaration to the end of the file. Each example walkthrough quotes rules from its spec as they
///     are written, continuation columns included, and the compiled spec is the same whichever way
///     those lines are laid out — so a reformat that moves them ships a quote that no longer matches
///     its source while every rule still passes. The marker is what holds the layout; this gate is
///     what notices a spec shipping without it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The arms read every tracked spec under an example's <c>arch</c> tree rather than four named
///         paths, so a fifth spec reds here on the day it lands unprotected.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The marker sits above the class and closes nowhere because the quoted blocks sit throughout
///         <c>Define</c>: the only placement that covers all of them is one above the declaration, and the
///         only closing marker that cannot re-expose one is none. The sample spec the grammar quotes
///         carries the same unbalanced marker for the same reason.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         That a quote still matches its source is <see cref="QuoteSyncTests" />'s job, for the fences
///         that are verbatim. The marker covers the fence that gate cannot register — a quote that inlines
///         a local the spec declares is not a substring of it — and the doc comments and the rest of the
///         file besides.
