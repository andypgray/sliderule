/// <summary>
///     The link gate over cited pages. A rule that carries a <c>Citation</c> renders its page into the
///     always-on managed block, where an agent reads it as the provenance of the law the bullet states —
///     so a page that has been moved or retired does not merely dangle, it hands every agent working in
///     this repository a dead reference as the authority for a rule it is being asked to follow, and
///     nothing else in the suite would say so. This gate holds every rendered citation to a page that
///     still answers.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The citations are read out of the committed context files rather than the specs, because the four
///         example specs are not reachable in this process. Each committed block is held equal to its model
///         by the dogfood tests here and by the examples being re-rendered and diffed.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The probe is opt-in because it is the one gate that needs the network. Every other gate in this
///         folder is a pure function of the checkout; this one cannot be. Unset, it skips before any I/O,
///         so a clone with no network and every CI leg that has not asked for it stay green and honest
///         rather than red for a reason that is not about this repository.
