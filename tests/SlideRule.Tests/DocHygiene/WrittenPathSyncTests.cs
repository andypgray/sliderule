///     The quote-sync gate over quoted write reports. The example walkthroughs quote captured
///     <c>render</c> and <c>baseline</c> output, whose every line names a file the verb touched:
///     <c>wrote arch/baselines/&lt;rule&gt;.json</c> when the bytes changed, <c>unchanged &lt;card&gt;</c>
///     when they did not. Nothing regenerates a hand-written doc, so this gate holds each quoted path to
///     the tracked file it names: a renamed baseline or a moved <c>AGENTS.md</c> fails the suite instead
///     of publishing a walkthrough that promises a file the repository no longer has.

///     captures — the file list — and like them it reads only committed bytes: no workspace load, no CLI
///     invocation, so it stays cheap and parallel-safe.
