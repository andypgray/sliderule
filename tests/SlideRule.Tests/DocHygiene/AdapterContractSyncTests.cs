/// <summary>
///     The sync gate over the xUnit adapter's contract, which two surfaces state independently: the
///     public xmldoc on <c>ArchRuleTests</c>, read as IntelliSense by a consumer who has only the
///     package, and the adapter package's README, its landing page on nuget.org. Neither can defer to
///     the other — public xmldoc may not cite a repository document and has to stand alone on hover,
///     and a reader on the package page cannot hover — so the overlap is deliberate, and this gate
///     holds it: a claim rewritten on one surface and left behind on the other fails the suite instead
///     of shipping two contracts under one name.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The other gates in this folder end on an inventory sweep that reds on something the registry
///         never listed. There is no such sweep here, because a claim is a sentence someone decided both
///         surfaces owe the reader and nothing in the text marks one out. The registry below is a floor
///         rather than a census: it holds what it lists, and a claim added to one surface alone is invisible
///         to it. That is the price of covering prose at all, and it is written here so the gate is not read
///         as coverage it does not have.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The two surfaces wrap differently, mark up differently (a <c>c</c> element against a backtick)
///         and escape differently, so one claim's raw bytes never appear in the other, and
///         <see cref="Normalize" /> takes both to the same plain prose before anything is searched for.
///         That is why <see cref="QuoteSyncTests" />' fence scanner cannot reach here: it matches one fence
///         line inside one source line, untrimmed.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The xmldoc side is read through <see cref="CommentText.Mask" /> over the whole source file
///         rather than the class doc alone, because several claims sit on the members they belong to. The
///         gate reads only committed bytes: no workspace load, no CLI invocation, so it stays cheap and
///         parallel-safe.
