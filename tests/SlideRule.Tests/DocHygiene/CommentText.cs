/// <summary>
///     Reduces C# source to the prose a maintainer wrote in it: every character outside comment trivia
///     is replaced with a blank, and comment text is left exactly where it sat. The result is the same
///     length as its input with newlines in their original positions, so a checker run over it reports
///     source line numbers without any offset arithmetic. A second reduction takes the directives back
///     out of that text, for a gate that wants the prose alone.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The blank is NUL rather than a space because U+0000 is neither a word character nor
///         whitespace to .NET's regex engine, so masked-out code can satisfy no part of any pattern —
///         not a <c>\s</c>, not a <c>\b</c>, not a literal. A space-filled gap looks like prose, and
///         a pattern that spans whitespace could report a match that exists in no comment. The blank
///         being inert is the property, and it holds for any pattern a future catalog adds rather
///         than for the ones written today.

///         Prose inside a disabled <c>#if</c> arm lexes as <c>DisabledTextTrivia</c>, and a <c>#region</c>
///         name lives on a directive rather than in a comment; neither is collected here. The source is
///         parsed with no preprocessor symbols defined, so even an <c>#if NET</c> arm, like the one the
///         MultiTfm fixture wraps a class in, is disabled text whose comments no gate built on this mask
///         reads. A reader should know the boundary rather than assume the mask covers everything a person
