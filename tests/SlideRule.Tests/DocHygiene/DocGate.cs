///     The scanning half every doc-quote gate in this folder shares: a hand-written registry of docs, a
///     scanner that lifts one shape of quoted output out of a doc's committed bytes, and the two facts
///     about the registry itself that every one of those gates has to state — that each registered doc
///     still yields something, and that no unregistered doc yields anything.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="TQuote">What the scanner lifts: a rule quote, a count, a written path, an anchor, a fence.</typeparam>

///     <para>
///         <b>Why the harness owns exactly these two facts.</b> They are the ones whose absence is silent:
///         a gate whose scanner stops matching goes green over nothing, and a doc nobody registered is
///         outside the gate with no failure anywhere. Everything a gate does with what it scanned —
///         classify, exempt, pin — stays in the gate, because the root pairing and the per-root hoist
///         those need are the gate's own.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why the nouns are parameters.</b> Each gate's failure text is the wording its reader already
///         knows, and sharing one harness across near-identical messages must not quietly normalize them.
///         So the emptiness header is composed from three words — the doc-set noun, the plural of what is
///         yielded, the scanner's name — and the registry sweep from three more, and each gate passes its
///         own. <see cref="DocGateTests" /> pins the composed text.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Scanning is memoized</b> because the registry sweep reads every tracked markdown file and the
///         gate's own facts then read the registered ones again. One <see cref="ConcurrentDictionary{TKey,TValue}" />
///         per gate keeps that to one scan per doc, and keeps it safe for a gate whose facts run in parallel.
