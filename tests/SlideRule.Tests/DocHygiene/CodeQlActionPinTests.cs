///         <b>What goes wrong without it.</b> The analyze step reads the configuration the init step
///         wrote and refuses one written by a different version, so a workflow whose two steps sit on
///         different revisions fails on a configuration-version mismatch. That ends the whole
///         code-scanning run rather than one query, and nothing before it complains: both pins are
///         valid SHAs, the YAML is well formed, and the split stays silent until the next analysis.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why the pair splits on its own.</b> Dependabot treats each action path as a separate
///         dependency, so an ungrouped bump raises one PR for <c>init</c> and another for
///         <c>analyze</c>, each carrying half the move. <c>.github/dependabot.yml</c> groups them for
///         that reason; this is what notices when the grouping stops working or a hand edit lands one
///         side of it.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Agreement is per workflow, not repository-wide.</b> What the action requires is that the
///         steps sharing a run share a version, and the <c>upload-sarif</c> steps in other workflows
///         upload a file rather than reading that configuration. Pinning those to the same revision
///         too would fail a standalone bump that is genuinely fine.
