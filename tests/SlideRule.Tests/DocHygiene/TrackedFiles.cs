///     <para>
///         Git decides the scope. What the hygiene gates check is that nothing internal ships
///         publicly, and tracked-by-git is what ships; every other definition of the set
///         approximates it — through a hand-written exclusion list whose going stale is the very
///         defect these gates exist to catch. Tracked-by-git also excludes the gitignored private
///         working layer and every build output without a list to maintain, and it cannot grow a
///         blind spot the day someone adds a top-level directory. When git is missing this throws
///         rather than yielding nothing, because a gate that silently scans an empty set is worse
///         than no gate.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Plain <c>ls-files</c>, not <c>-z</c>: <see cref="ChildProcess.Run" />'s capture is
///         line-oriented and LF-normalized, which is exactly what plain <c>ls-files</c> emits. The
///         quoting that <c>-z</c> exists to solve is instead pinned absent by a fact over the path
///         character set, so the day a path needs quoting the gate says so rather than silently
///         dropping the file.
