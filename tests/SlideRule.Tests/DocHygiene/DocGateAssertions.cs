/// <summary>
///     The assertion every gate in this folder ends on: the findings it collected must be empty, and the
///     header says what a non-empty list means. Composes <c>"{header}:\n{one finding per line}"</c> as the
///     failure reason, so a red opens with the drift itself rather than with a count.

///     <para>
///         Attributed <c>[ShouldlyMethods]</c>, which inverts the reason the suite's other assertion
///         helpers leave it off — and the inversion is the point rather than an oversight. Shouldly derives
///         the "actual" half of its message from the first stack frame after the last attributed one and
///         reads that line off disk. In those helpers the frame left showing is a property read worth
///         naming, so the attribute stays off and a red reads <c>violation.Target!.FullName should be …</c>.
///         Here the frame inside this file is <c>findings.ShouldBeEmpty(…)</c>, whose subject is this
///         method's own parameter; attributed, the reader gets the caller's line instead and the red names
///         the list the gate actually built — <c>drift</c>, <c>unregistered</c>, <c>dead</c>.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         That holds only while this method keeps a frame of its own, because Shouldly searches the
///         caller's line for the name of the outermost attributed frame. Called by every gate, the method is
///         hot enough in a full Release run to be compiled optimized, where its one call can become a tail
///         call into <c>ShouldBeEmpty</c> that takes this frame with it: Shouldly then searches the caller's
///         line for <c>ShouldBeEmpty</c>, finds nothing, and the red names the list's contents instead of
///         the list. Measured on Windows: two full Release runs produced exactly that red, and the pin run
///         alone never did. <c>NoInlining</c> and <c>NoOptimization</c> keep the frame in every build and tier.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Takes a materialized collection rather than a sequence, because the findings are enumerated
///         twice — once to compose the message and once by Shouldly — and every caller has already built a
///         list.
